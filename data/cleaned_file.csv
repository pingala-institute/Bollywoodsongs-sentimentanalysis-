see who will run away and come back, what did you think when I lost my coin, when you used to sleep with the chain at night, then I used to sow the seed of rape, I would beat the words from the heart, you are not like that in this game, tell me sons, you will do it lie, if what I say is wrong then come and expose me, I am the sole, speak my soul, making me the biggest Emcee is my goal, my real eyes, I realise, the real lies, I sing on my own dime, only then fear dies, I am not divine but do 25 jobs a day, I rewind the monkey with glasses, if I make a mistake then I never say that my mind is on fire, if I make a mistake then I say that you are fine, how many say that I do this for views, it is not a matter of truth I do this, the reality is that I want to make myself huge, further in my life I choose rap, I say that it is Good for nothing, I am insane, I hear this every time, I feel great pain, prove I will do it and I will gain more, this is what my name is worth, now I am in rap, my family supported me in everything, I jealous of the rappers in Haridwar, if there is one real one there are thousands of fake ones, Today I have a hip hop market here, everyone is doing beef battle, these scenes are weird, they do battle, they are standing like gods, they are always ready to fight, I also enjoy it this is my thought, at this time this is the scene of hip hop, there are so many rappers here in this scene, but I have faith in myself, I do rap brother, this is my teen, I am Bolu ki I mean it,I'm in it to win it, I'll kill every villain, I bit 'em, I spit out the venom, I live in the minute,I will do it only when I am small,I will die,As long as I am alive I won't suffer,If I am right then I will fight the world,If I am right then I won't be afraid of anyone,I admit that I was a little off beat earlier,But I don't repeat my words,If I took any rapper's name then it would have been hot,He never abuses even once,My songs are neat,I studied Dasvi's child all the
