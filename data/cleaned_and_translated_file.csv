Ruk Ruk Ruk,Alisha Chinai,1994,he had been sitting there for an hour and a half already and all that time his imagination had been busy picturing his moscow rooms his moscow friends his man pyotr and his writingtable he gazed half wonderingly at the dark motionless trees and it seemed strange to him that he was living now not in his summer villa at sokolniki but in a provincial town in a house by which a great herd of cattle was driven every morning and evening accompanied by terrible clouds of dust and the blowing of a horn he thought of long conversations in which he had taken part quite lately in moscow—conversations in which it had been maintained that one could live without love that passionate love was an obsession that finally there is no such love but only a physical attraction between the sexes—and so on in the same style he remembered them and thought mournfully that if he were asked now what love was he could not have found an answerthe service was over the people began to appear laptev strained his eyes gazing at the dark figures the bishop had been driven by in his carriage the bells had stopped ringing and the red and green lights in the belfry were one after another extinguished— there had been an illumination as it was dedication day—but the people were still coming out lingering talking and standing under the windows but at last laptev heard a familiar voice his heart began beating violently and he was overcome with despair on seeing that yulia sergeyevna was not alone but walking with two ladiesits awful awful he whispered feeling jealous its awfulat the corner of the lane she stopped to say goodbye to the ladies and while doing so glanced at laptevi was coming to see you he said im coming for a chat with your father is he at homemost likely she answered its early for him to have gone to the clubthere were gardens all along the lane and a row of limetrees growing by the fence cast a broad patch of shadow in the moonlight so that the gate and the fences were completely plunged in darkness on one side from which came the sounds of women whispering smothered laughter and someone playing softly on a balalaika there was a fragrance of limeflowers and of hay this fragrance and the murmur of the unseen whispers worked upon laptev he was all at once overwhelmed with a passionate longing to throw his arms round his companion to shower kisses on her face her hands her shoulders to burst into sobs to fall at her feet and to tell her how long he had been waiting for her a faint scarcely perceptible scent of incense hung about her and that scent reminded him of the time when he too believed in god and used to go to evening service and when he used to dream so much of pure romantic love and it seemed to him that because this girl did not love him all possibility of the happiness he had dreamed of then was lost to him forevershe began speaking sympathetically of the illness of his sister nina fyodorovna two months before his sister had undergone an operation for cancer and now every one was expecting a return of the diseasei went to see her this morning said yulia sergeyevna and it seemed to me that during the last week she has not exactly grown thin but has as it were fadedyes yes laptev agreed theres no return of the symptoms but every day i notice she grows weaker and weaker and is wasting before my eyes i dont understand whats the matter with heroh dear and how strong she used to be plump and rosy said yulia sergeyevna after a moments silence every one here used to call her the moscow lady how she used to laugh on holidays she used to dress up like a peasant girl and it suited her so welldoctor sergey borisovitch was at home he was a stout redfaced man wearing a long coat that reached below his knees and looking as though he had short legs he was pacing up and down his study with his hands in his pockets and humming to himself in an undertone rurururu his grey whiskers looked unkempt and his hair was unbrushed as though he had just got out of bed and his study with pillows on the sofa with stacks of papers in the corners and with a dirty invalid poodle lying under the table produced the same impression of unkemptness and untidiness as himselfm laptev wants to see you his daughter said to him going into his studyrurururu he hummed louder than ever and turning into the drawingroom gave his hand to laptev and asked what good news have you to tell meit was dark in the drawingroom laptev still standing with his hat in his hand began apologising for disturbing him he asked what was to be done to make his sister sleep at night and why she was growing so thin and he was embarrassed by the thought that he had asked those very questions at his visit that morningtell me he said wouldnt it be as well to send for some specialist on internal diseases from moscow what do you think of itthe doctor sighed shrugged his shoulders and made a vague gesture with his handsit was evident that he was offended he was a very huffy man prone to take offence and always ready to suspect that people did not believe in him that he was not recognised or properly respected that his patients exploited him and that his colleagues showed him illwill he was always jeering at himself saying that fools like him were only made for the public to ride roughshod over themyulia sergeyevna lighted the lamp she was tired out with the service and that was evident from her pale exhausted face and her weary step she wanted to rest she sat down on the sofa put her hands on her lap and sank into thought laptev knew that he was ugly and now he felt as though he were conscious of his ugliness all over his body he was short thin with ruddy cheeks and his hair had grown so thin that his head felt cold in his expression there was none of that refined simplicity which makes even rough ugly faces attractive in the society of women he was awkward overtalkative affected and now he almost despised himself for it he must talk that yulia sergeyevna might not be bored in his company but what about about his sisters illness againand he began to talk about medicine saying what is usually said he approved of hygiene and said that he had long ago wanted to found a nightrefuge in moscow—in fact he had already calculated the cost of it according to his plan the workmen who came in the evening to the nightrefuge were to receive a supper of hot cabbage soup with bread a warm dry bed with a rug and a place for drying their clothes and their bootsyulia sergeyevna was usually silent in his presence and in a strange way perhaps by the instinct of a lover he divined her thoughts and intentions and now from the fact that after the evening service she had not gone to her room to change her dress and drink tea he deduced that she was going to pay some visit elsewherebut im in no hurry with the nightrefuge he went on speaking with vexation and irritability and addressing the doctor who looked at him as it were blankly and in perplexity evidently unable to understand what induced him to raise the question of medicine and hygiene and most likely it will be a long time too before i make use of our estimate i fear our nightshelter will fall into the hands of our pious humbugs and philanthropic ladies who always ruin any undertakingyulia sergeyevna got up and held out her hand to laptevexcuse me she said its time for me to go please give my love to your sisterrurururu hummed the doctor rurururuyulia sergeyevna went out and after staying a little longer laptev said goodbye to the doctor and went home when a man is dissatisfied and feels unhappy how trivial seem to him the shapes of the limetrees the shadows the clouds all the beauties of nature so complacent so indifferent by now the moon was high up in the sky and the clouds were scudding quickly below but how naïve and provincial the moon is how threadbare and paltry the clouds thought laptev he felt ashamed of the way he had talked just now about medicine and the nightrefuge he felt with horror that next day he would not have will enough to resist trying to see her and talk to her again and would again be convinced that he was nothing to her and the day after—it would be the same with what object and how and when would it all endat home he went in to see his sister nina fyodorovna still looked strong and gave the impression of being a wellbuilt vigorous woman but her striking pallor made her look like a corpse especially when as now she was lying on her back with her eyes closed her eldest daughter sasha a girl of ten years old was sitting beside her reading aloud from her readingbookalyosha has come the invalid said softly to herselfthere had long been established between sasha and her uncle a tacit compact to take turns in sitting with the patient on this occasion sasha closed her readingbook and without uttering a word went softly out of the room laptev took an historical novel from the chest of drawers and looking for the right page sat down and began reading it aloudnina fyodorovna was born in moscow of a merchant family she and her two brothers had spent their childhood and early youth living at home in pyatnitsky street their childhood was long and wearisome her father treated her sternly and had even on two or three occasions flogged her and her mother had had a long illness and died the servants were coarse dirty and hypocritical the house was frequented by priests and monks also hypocritical they ate and drank and coarsely flattered her father whom they did not like the boys had the goodfortune to go to school while nina was left practically uneducated all her life she wrote an illegible scrawl and had read nothing but historical novels seventeen years ago when she was twentytwo on a summer holiday at himki she made the acquaintance of her present husband a landowner called panaurov had fallen in love with him and married him secretly against her fathers will panaurov a handsome rather impudent fellow who whistled and lighted his cigarette from the holy lamp struck the father as an absolutely worthless person and when the soninlaw began in his letters demanding a dowry the old man wrote to his daughter that he would send her furs silver and various articles that had been left at her mothers death as well as thirty thousand roubles but without his paternal blessing later he sent another twenty thousand this money as well as the dowry was spent the estate had been sold and panaurov moved with his family to the town and got a job in a provincial government office in the town he formed another tie and had a second family and this was the subject of much talk as his illicit family was not a secretnina fyodorovna adored her husband and now listening to the historical novel she was thinking how much she had gone through in her life how much she had suffered and that if any one were to describe her life it would make a very pathetic story as the tumour was in her breast she was persuaded that love and her domestic grief were the cause of her illness and that jealousy and tears had brought her to her hopeless stateat last alexey fyodorovitch closed the book and saidthats the end and thank god for it tomorrow well begin a new onenina fyodorovna laughed she had always been given to laughter but of late laptev had begun to notice that at moments her mind seemed weakened by illness and she would laugh at the smallest trifle and even without any cause at allyulia came before dinner while you were out she said so far as i can see she hasnt much faith in her papa let papa go on treating you she said but write in secret to the holy elder to pray for you too there is a holy man somewhere here yulia forgot her parasol here you must take it to her tomorrow she went on after a brief pause no when the end comes neither doctors nor holy men are any helpnina why cant you sleep at night laptev asked to change the subjectoh well i dont go to sleep—thats all i lie and thinkwhat do you think about dearabout the children about you    about my life ive gone through a great deal alyosha you know when one begins to remember and remember    my god she laughed its no joke to have borne five children as i have to have buried three   sometimes i was expecting to be confined while my grigory nikolaitch would be sitting at that very time with another woman there would be no one to send for the doctor or the midwife i would go into the passage or the kitchen for the servant and there jews tradesmen moneylenders would be waiting for him to come home my head used to go round     he did not love me though he never said so openly now ive grown calmer—it doesnt weigh on my heart but in old days when i was younger it hurt me—ach how it hurt me darling once— while we were still in the country—i found him in the garden with a lady and i walked away   i walked on aimlessly and i dont know how but i found myself in the church porch i fell on my knees queen of heaven i said and it was night the moon was shining   she was exhausted she began gasping for breath then after resting a little she took her brothers hand and went on in a weak toneless voicehow kind you are alyosha    and how clever    what a good man youve grown up intoat midnight laptev said goodnight to her and as he went away he took with him the parasol that yulia sergeyevna had forgotten in spite of the late hour the servants male and female were drinking tea in the diningroom how disorderly the children were not in bed but were there in the diningroom too they were all talking softly in undertones and had not noticed that the lamp was smoking and would soon go out all these people big and little were disturbed by a whole succession of bad omens and were in an oppressed mood the glass in the hall had been broken the samovar had been buzzing every day and as though on purpose was even buzzing now they were describing how a mouse had jumped out of nina fyodorovnas boot when she was dressing and the children were quite aware of the terrible significance of these omens the elder girl sasha a thin little brunette was sitting motionless at the table and her face looked scared and woebegone while the younger lida a chubby fair child of seven stood beside her sister looking from under her brows at the lightlaptev went downstairs to his own rooms in the lower storey where under the low ceilings it was always close and smelt of geraniums in his sittingroom panaurov nina fyodorovnas husband was sitting reading the newspaper laptev nodded to him and sat down opposite both sat still and said nothing they used to spend whole evenings like this without speaking and neither of them was in the least put out by this silencethe little girls came down from upstairs to say goodnight deliberately and in silence panaurov made the sign of the cross over them several times and gave them his hand to kiss they dropped curtsies and then went up to laptev who had to make the sign of the cross and give them his hand to kiss also this ceremony with the handkissing and curtsying was repeated every eveningwhen the children had gone out panaurov laid aside the newspaper and saidits not very lively in our godfearing town i must confess my dear fellow he added with a sigh im very glad that at last youve found some distractionwhat do you mean asked laptevi saw you coming out of dr byelavins just now i expect you dont go there for the sake of the papaof course not said laptev and he blushedwell of course not and by the way you wouldnt find such another old brute as that papa if you hunted by daylight with a candle you cant imagine what a foul stupid clumsy beast he is you cultured people in the capitals are still interested in the provinces only on the lyrical side only from the paysage and poor anton point of view but i can assure you my boy theres nothing logical about it theres nothing but barbarism meanness and nastiness—thats all take the local devotees of science—the local intellectuals so to speak can you imagine there are here in this town twentyeight doctors theyve all made their fortunes and they are living in houses of their own and meanwhile the population is in just as helpless a condition as ever here nina had to have an operation quite an ordinary one really yet we were obliged to get a surgeon from moscow not one doctor here would undertake it its beyond all conception they know nothing they understand nothing they take no interest in anything ask them for instance what cancer is—what it is what it comes fromand panaurov began to explain what cancer was he was a specialist on all scientific subjects and explained from a scientific point of view everything that was discussed but he explained it all in his own way he had a theory of his own about the circulation of the blood about chemistry about astronomy he talked slowly softly convincinglyits beyond all conception he pronounced in an imploring voice screwing up his eyes sighing languidly and smiling as graciously as a king and it was evident that he was very well satisfied with himself and never gave a thought to the fact that he was fiftyi am rather hungry said laptev i should like something savourywell that can easily be managednot long afterwards laptev and his brotherinlaw were sitting upstairs in the diningroom having supper laptev had a glass of vodka and then began drinking wine panaurov drank nothing he never drank and never gambled yet in spite of that he had squandered all his own and his wifes property and had accumulated debts to squander so much in such a short time one must have not passions but a special talent panaurov liked dainty fare liked a handsome dinner service liked music after dinner speeches bowing footmen to whom he would carelessly fling tips of ten even twentyfive roubles he always took part in all lotteries and subscriptions sent bouquets to ladies of his acquaintance on their birthdays bought cups stands for glasses studs ties walkingsticks scents cigaretteholders pipes lapdogs parrots japanese bricàbrac antiques he had silk nightshirts and a bedstead made of ebony inlaid with motherofpearl his dressinggown was a genuine bokhara and everything was to correspond and on all this there went every day as he himself expressed a deluge of moneyat supper he kept sighing and shaking his headyes everything on this earth has an end he said softly screwing up his dark eyes you will fall in love and suffer you will fall out of love youll be deceived for there is no woman who will not deceive you will suffer will be brought to despair and will be faithless too but the time will come when all this will be a memory and when you will reason about it coldly and look upon it as utterly trivial   laptev tired a little drunk looked at his handsome head his clipped black beard and seemed to understand why women so loved this pampered conceited and physically handsome creatureafter supper panaurov did not stay in the house but went off to his other lodgings laptev went out to see him on his way panaurov was the only man in the town who wore a tophat and his elegant dandified figure his tophat and tan gloves beside the grey fences the pitiful little houses with their three windows and the thickets of nettles always made a strange and mournful impressionafter saying goodbye to him laptev returned home without hurrying the moon was shining brightly one could distinguish every straw on the ground and laptev felt as though the moonlight were caressing his bare head as though some one were passing a feather over his hairi love he pronounced aloud and he had a sudden longing to run to overtake panaurov to embrace him to forgive him to make him a present of a lot of money and then to run off into the open country into a wood to run on and on without looking backat home he saw lying on the chair the parasol yulia sergeyevna had forgotten he snatched it up and kissed it greedily the parasol was a silk one no longer new tied round with old elastic the handle was a cheap one of white bone laptev opened it over him and he felt as though there were the fragrance of happiness about himhe settled himself more comfortably in his chair and still keeping hold of the parasol began writing to moscow to one of his friendsdear precious kostyahere is news for you im in love again i say again because six years ago i fell in love with a moscow actress though i didnt even succeed in making her acquaintance and for the last year and a half i have been living with a certain person you know—a woman neither young nor goodlooking ah my dear boy how unlucky i am in love ive never had any success with women and if i say again its simply because its rather sad and mortifying to acknowledge even to myself that my youth has passed entirely without love and that im in love in a real sense now for the first time in my life at thirtyfour let it stand that i love againif only you knew what a girl she was she couldnt be called a beauty—she has a broad face she is very thin but what a wonderful expression of goodness she has when she smiles when she speaks her voice is as clear as a bell she never carries on a conversation with me—i dont know her but when im beside her i feel shes a striking exceptional creature full of intelligence and lofty aspirations she is religious and you cannot imagine how deeply this touches me and exalts her in my eyes on that point i am ready to argue with you endlessly you may be right to your thinking but still i love to see her praying in church she is a provincial but she was educated in moscow she loves our moscow she dresses in the moscow style and i love her for that—love her love her     i see you frowning and getting up to read me a long lecture on what love is and what sort of woman one can love and what sort one cannot and so on and so on but dear kostya before i was in love i too knew quite well what love wasmy sister thanks you for your message she often recalls how she used to take kostya kotchevoy to the preparatory class and never speaks of you except as poor kostya as she still thinks of you as the little orphan boy she remembers and so poor orphan im in love while its a secret dont say anything to a certain person i think it will all come right of itself or as the footman says in tolstoy will come roundwhen he had finished his letter laptev went to bed he was so tired that he couldnt keep his eyes open but for some reason he could not get to sleep the noise in the street seemed to prevent him the cattle were driven by to the blowing of a horn and soon afterwards the bells began ringing for early mass at one minute a cart drove by creaking at the next he heard the voice of some woman going to market and the sparrows twittered the whole timeembed

gathered to drift slowly up the river shannon and settle forever in limerick the rain dampened the city from the feast of the circumcision to new years eveit created a cacophony of hacking coughs bronchial rattles asthmatic wheezes consumptive croaks it turned noses into fountains lungs into bacterial sponges it provoked cures galore to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles wrapped it in a rag and slapped it sizzling on the chestfrom october to april the walls of limerick glistened with the damp clothes never dried tweed and woolen coats housed living things sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations in pubs steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his weeks wagesthe rain drove us into the churchour refuge our strength our only dry place at mass benediction novenas we huddled in great damp clumps dozing through priest drone while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the

my father the thinning hair the collapsing teeth and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that when i was thirteen my fathers mother told me a secret as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head it was an accident he was never the same after and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiarbecause of the price on the head he had been dropped on

a truck he and his friend john mcerlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along myrtle avenue they pulled it over the police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing not pork and beans but cases of buttonswith angela drawn to the hangdog look and malachy lonely after three months in jail there was bound to be a kneetremblera kneetrembler is the act itself done up against a wall man and woman up on their toes straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement thats in itthat kneetrembler put angela in an interesting condition and of course there was talk angela had cousins the macnamara sisters delia and philomena married respectively to jimmy fortune of county mayo and tommy flynn of brooklyn itselfdelia and philomena were large women greatbreasted and fierce when they sailed along the sidewalks of brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside respect was shown the sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the one holy roman catholic and apostolic church they knew that angela unmarried had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take stepssteps they took with jimmy and tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on atlantic avenue where malachy could be found on friday payday when he had a job the man in the speak joey cacciamani did not want to admit the sisters but philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges hed better open up for they were there on gods business joey said awright awright you irish jeezoz trouble troublemalachy at the far end of the bar turned pale gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile offered them a drink they resisted the smile and spurned the offer delia said we dont know what class of a tribe you come from in the north of irelandphilomena said there is a suspicion you might have presbyterians in your family which would explain what you did to our cousinjimmy said ah now ah now tisnt his fault if theres presbyterians in his familydelia said you shudduptommy had to join in what you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the irish race and you should be ashamed of yourselfoch i am said malachy i amnobody asked you to talk said philomena you done enough damage with your blather so shut your yapand while your yap is shut said delia were here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin angela sheehanmalachy said och indeed indeed the right thing is the right thing and id be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this littletalktake the drink said tommy and shove it up your assphilomena said our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat thanyou are at her we have morals in limerick you know morals were not like jackrabbits from antrim a place crawling with presbyteriansjimmy said he dont look like a presbyterianyou shuddup said deliaanother thing we noticed said philomena you have a very oddmannermalachy smiled i doaboutyou do says delia i think tis one of the first things we noticed you that odd manner and it gives us a very uneasy feelingtis that sneaky little presbyterian smile said philomenaoch said malachy its just the trouble i have with my teeth teeth or no teeth odd manner or no odd manner youre gonna marrythat girl said tommy up the middle aisle youre goingoch said malachy i wasnt planning to get married you knowtheres no work and i wouldnt be able to support married is what youre going to be said delia up the middle aisle said jimmyyou shuddup said deliamalachy watched them leave im in a desperate pickle he told joey cacciamanibet your ass said joey i see them babes comin at me i jump inna hudson rivermalachy considered the pickle he was in he had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in san francisco or one of the other california sans wouldnt he be better off in california far from the great breasted macnamara sisters and their grim husbands he would indeed and hed have a drop of the irish to celebrate his decision and departure joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off malachys gullet irish indeed he told joey it was a prohibition concoction from the devils own still joey shrugged i dont know nothing i only pour still it was better than nothing and malachy would have another and one for yourself joey and ask them two decent italians what theyd like and what are you talking about of course i have the money to pay for ithe awoke on a bench in the long island railroad station a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick his escape money gone the macnamara sisters ready to eat him alive in brooklynon the feast of st joseph a bitter day in march four months after the kneetrembler malachy married angela and in august the child was born in november malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the childs birth he thought he might name the child malachy after himself but his north of ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name male on the certificatenot until late december did they take male to st pauls church to be baptized and named francis after his fathers father and the lovely saint of assisi angela wanted to give him a middle name munchin after the patron saint of limerick but malachy said over his dead body no son of his would have a limerick name its hard enough going through life with one name sticking on middle names was an atrocious american habit and there was no need for a second name when youre christened after the man from assisithere was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather john mcerlaine got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities philomena told her husband tommy hed have to be godfather childs soul is in danger she said tommy put his head down and grumbled all right ill be godfather but im not goin to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin trouble and goin through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to john mcerlaine at the speakeasy the priest said true for you tom decent man that you are fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy malachy fresh from the speakeasy himself felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest one sacrilege on top of another take off that collar and well see whos the man he had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim angela new mother agitated forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font a total immersion of the protestant type the altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to angela who sobbed and clutched him dripping to her bosom the priest laughed said he had never seen the likes that the child was a regular little baptist now and hardly needed a priest this maddened malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a protestant the priest said quiet man youre in gods house and when malachy said gods house my arse he was thrown out on court street because you cant say arse in gods houseafter baptism philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner malachy said tea and she said yes tea or is it whiskey you want he said tea was grand but first hed have to go and deal with john mcerlaine who didnt have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather angela said youre only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy and he said as god is my witness the drink is the last thing on my mind angela started to cry your sons christening day and you have to go drinking delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the north of irelandmalachy looked from one to the other shifted on his feet pulled his cap down over his eyes shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets said och aye the way they do in the far reaches of county antrim turned hurried up court street to the speakeasy on atlantic avenue where he was sure theyd ply him with free drink in honor of his sons baptismat philomenas house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at angela thats what you get for being such a fool hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic you shoulda stayed single put the child up for adoption and youd be a free woman today angela cried harder and delia took up the attack oh stop it angela stop it you have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin into trouble with a drunkard from the north a man that doesnt even look like a catholic him with his odd manner id saythat that malachy has a streak of the presbyterian in him right enough you shuddup jimmyif i was you said philomena id make sure theres no more children he dont have a job so he dont an never will the way he drinks so no more children angela are you listenin to mei am philomenaa year later another child was born angela called him malachy after his father and gave him a middle name gerard after his fathers brotherthe macnamara sisters said angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came

frankie has the odd manner like his father i wonder what the odd manner is but i cant ask because im not supposed to be listeningi wish i could swing up into the sky up into the clouds i might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers oliver and eugene cry in the middle of the night anymore my mother says theyre always hungry she cries in the middle of the night too she says shes worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her she wishes she had one little girl all for herself shed give anything for one little girlim in the playground with

suffering ireland mam gets angry and says ireland can kiss her arse he says thats nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language food on the table is what she wants not suffering ireland she says it was a sad day prohibition ended because dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch rye bread corned beef pickles he puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself he says food is a shock to the system and he doesnt know where we get our appetites mamsaysthey get their appetites because theyre starving half the timewhen dad gets a job mam is cheerful and she sings anyone can see why i wanted your kissit had to be and the reason is thiscould it be true someone like youcould love me love mewhen dad brings home the first weeks wages mam is delighted she can pay the lovely italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because theres nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone she cleans the kitchen washes the mugs and plates brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another italian she buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that she says is better than having the headlines from the daily news blackening your arse she boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks diapers for the twins our two sheets our three towels she hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun she says you wouldnt want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but theres nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sunwhen dad brings home the first weeks wages on a friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful on saturday night mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and dad will dry us malachy will turn around and show his behind dad will pretend to be shocked and well all laugh mam will make hot cocoa and well be able to stay up while dad tells us a story out of his head all we have to do issay a name mr macadorey or mr leibowitz down the hall and dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in brazil chased by indians with green noses and puce shoulders on nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs fried tomatoes and fried bread tea with lashings of sugar and milk and later in the day a big dinner of mashed potatoes peas and ham and a trifle mam makes layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherrywhen dad brings home the first weeks wages and the weather is fine mam takes us to the playground she sits on a bench and talks to minnie macadorey she tells minnie stories about characters in limerick and minnie tells her about characters in belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in ireland north and south then they teach each other sad songs and malachy and i leave the swings and seesaws to sit with them on the bench and sing a group of young soldiers one night in a camp were talking of sweethearts they hadall seemed so merry except one young lad and he was downhearted and sadcome and join us said one of the boys surely theres someone for youbut ned shook his head and proudly he said i am in love with two each like a mother to mefrom neither of them shall i partfor one is my mothergod bless her and love herthe other is my sweetheartmalachy and i sing that song and mam and minnie laugh till they cry at the way malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to mam at the end dan macadorey comes along on his way home from work and says rudy vallee better start worrying about the competitionwhen we go home mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt dad drinks the tea and eats nothing mam says god above how can you work all day and not eat he says the tea is enough she says youll ruin your health and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system he drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the daily news or he smokes a cigarette stares at the wall runs his tongue over his lipswhen dads job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages on friday night we wait for him and mam gives us bread and tea the darkness comes down and the lights come on along classon avenue other men with jobs are home already and having eggs

Rabba (Lounge Mix),Richa Sharma,2004,and what befel them of things seldseen and peregrinethe king asked her and what was their story and she answered it hath reached me o auspicious king that there was in the city of safety baghdad before the caliphate of abd almalik bin marwán a king omar bin alnuumán highs who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the chosroës of persia and the kaysars of eastern rome for none could warm himself at his fire nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray and when he was angered there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame he had made himself king over all quarters and allah had subjected to him all his creatures his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands east and west had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them hind and sind and sin the holy land alhijaz the rich mountains of alyaman and the archipelagos of india and china moreover he reigned supreme over the north country and diyár bakr or mesopotamia and over sudán the eastern negro land and the islands of the ocean and all the far famed rivers of the earth sayhún and jayhún nile and euphrates he sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote to provide him with true report and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for king omar bin alnuuman for he was o ruler of the age a right noble king and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing this mighty monarch had a son yclept sharrkan who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban for this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater and made him heir to the kingdom after himself this prince grew up till he reached mans estate and was twenty years old and allah subjected his servants to him by reason of his great might and prowess in battle now his father king omar had four wives legally married but allah had vouchsafed him no son by them save sharrkan whom he had begotten upon one of them and the rest were barren moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines after the number of days in the coptic year who were of all nations and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace for he had built twelve pavilions after the number of the months each containing thirty private chambers which thus numbered three hundred and three score wherein he lodged his handmaids and he appointed according to law for each one her night when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year and on this wise he abode for a length of time meanwhile his son sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities presently by decree of the decreer a handmaid among the handmaids of omar bin nuuman became pregnant and her pregnancy being announced to the harim the king was informed thereof whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said haply it will be a son and so all my offspring will be males then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness but when the tidings came to sharrkan he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous and he said verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty so quoth he to himself if this concubine bear a male child i will kill it but he kept that intention hidden in his heart such was the case with sharrkan but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows she was a roumiyah a greek girl by name sofiyah or sophia whom the king of roum and lord of cæsarea had sent to king omar as a present together with great store of gifts and of rarities she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating now she had served the king on the night of his sleeping with her saying to him o king i desire of the god of the heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me so i may bring him up with the best of rearing and enable him to reach mans estate perfect in intelligence good manners and prudent bearing—a speech which much pleased the king during her pregnancy she was instant in prayer fervently supplicating the lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her and allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool now the king had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female and in like way his son sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same in due time sophia was delivered of a child which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon so they announced this to all present in the room whereupon the kings messenger carried the news to him and sharrkans eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy but after the two had departed quoth sophia to the midwives wait with me awhile for i feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her and allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child the wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon with forehead flower white and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light whereupon the mother rejoiced as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company and sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy the rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot and the tidings reached omar son of al nuuman who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news then he rose and went to her and kissed her head after which he looked at the boy and bending over him kissed him whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music and the king gave order that the boy should be named zau almakán and his sister nuzhat alzamán they answered hearing and obedience and did his bidding so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside beyond the power of tongue to rehearse moreover the people of baghdad hearing that allah had blessed their king with issue decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom and the emirs and wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished king omar bin alnuuman joy of his son zau almakan and of his daughter nuzhat alzaman wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts and dealt largesse to all gentle and simple who were present after this fashion he did for four days full told and he lavished upon sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth and every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the newborns and when four years had gone by he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions all this while his son sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father omar son of alnuuman having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of nuzhat alzaman and they hid the intelligence from him until days and years had sped by whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights one day as king omar was sitting in his palace his chamberlains came in to him and kissing the ground before him said o king there be come ambassadors from the king of roum lord of constantinople the great and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree if the king commend us to introduce them we will so do and if not there is no disputing his behest he bade them enter and when they came in he turned to them and courteously receiving them asked them of their case and what was the cause of their coming they kissed the ground before him and said o king glorious and strong o lord of the arm that is long know that he who despatched us to thee is king afrídún lord of ionia land and of the nazarene armies the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of constantinople to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel the prince of casarea and the cause of this war is as follows one of the kings of the arabs in past time during certain of his conquests chanced upon a hoard of the time of alexander whence he removed wealth past compute and amongst other things three round jewels big as ostrich eggs from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man upon each were graven characts in ionian characters and they have many virtues and properties amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a newborn child no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail when the arab king laid hands upon them and learned their secrets he sent to king afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned and he equipped for the mission two ships one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels for that he was king of the arabs and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the king of constantinople and they were bound to his port nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the great king afridun the two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the prince of caesarea who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships together with the three jewels and slew the crews when our king heard of this he sent an army against them but they routed it then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight—whereupon the king waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army nor would he turn back from them till he had left caesarea of armenia in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her prince held sway so he sent us to the lord of the age and the time sultan omar bin alnuuman king of baghdad and of khorasan desiring that he aid us with an army so may honour and glory accrue to him and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents and of the kings grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance then the ambassadors kissed the ground before him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the fortysixth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that after the ambassadors and retinue from the constantinopolitan king had kissed the ground before omar and had delivered their embassage they brought out the presents which were fifty damsels of the choicest from graecialand and fifty mamelukes in tunics of brocade belted with girdles of gold and silver each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one the girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money when the king saw them he rejoiced in them and accepted them then he bade the ambassadors be honourably entreated and summoning his wazirs took counsel with them of what he should do herewith rose up among them a wazir an ancient man dandan highs who kissed the ground before omar and said o king there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious and set over it thy son sharrkan with us as his lieutenants and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts first because the king of roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted and secondly because while no enemy dareth attack our country thine army may go forth safely and should it succour the king of graecialand and defeat his foe the glory will be thine moreover the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially when the tidings shall reach the islands of the ocean and the kings of mauritania shall hear it they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money the king pleased by the wazirs words and approving his rede gave him a dress of honour and said to him of the like of thee should kings ask counsel and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son sharrkan command the main battle then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down and he expounded to him the matter telling him what the ambassadors and the wazir dandan had said and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign enjoining him not to gainsay dandan in aught he should do moreover he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen armed capàpie and inured to onset and stress of war accordingly sharrkan arose on the instant and chose out a myriad of horsemen after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them saying ye have delay of three days they kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions and provide provisions for the occasion whilst sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others when the appointed three days were ended the army drew out to the suburbs of baghdad city and king omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the king seven parcels of money then he turned to danden and commended to his care the army of his son and the wazir kissed the ground before him and answered i hear and i obey and lastly he charged sharrkan that he should consult the wazir on all occasions which he promised to do after this the king returned to his city and sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array so they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen besides footmen and camp followers then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled whilst sharrkan mounted horse with the wazir dandan by his side and the colours fluttering over their heads so the host fared forth and stinted not faring with the ambassadors preceding them till day departed and night drew nigh when they alighted and encamped for the night and as soon as allah caused the morn tomorrow they mounted and tried on guided by the ambassadors for a space of twenty days and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious wady well grown with trees and shrubbery here sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days halt so they dismounted and pitched their tents spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley whilst the wazir dandan and the ambassadors of king afridun pitched in the sole of the wady as for sharrkan he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides he then slacked the reins of his steed being minded to explore the wady and to mount guard in his own person because of his fathers charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of graecia land and in the enemys country so he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the wazir dandan and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him so that he could no longer urge horse with heel now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback so when slumber overpowered him he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets which was dense with growth but sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons eastern and western he was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which neer yet shamed its sayer there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great but as he rode on in fear of wild beasts behold the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of paradise and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men so king sharrkan alighted and tying his steed to one of the trees went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in arabic and saying now by the crush of the messiah this is not well of you but whose utters a word i will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle he kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold a stream was gushing and flowing and antelopes at large were frisking and roving and wild cattle amid the pasture moving and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs even as a poet described it in these coupletsmost beautiful is earth in budding bloom  when lucid waters            course through plain and woodno work but his th all great th all glorious  giver of all            gifts giver of all goodand as sharrkan considered the place he saw in it a christian monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon through the midst of the convent passed a stream the water flowing amongst its gardens and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder high bosomed virgins as saith of them the poet in these coupletsthe mead is bright with what is ont  of merry maidens            debonnairdouble its beauty and its grace  those trooping damsels slender           fairvirgins of graceful swimming gait  ready with eye and lip to            ensnareand like the tendrild vine they loose  the rich profusion of            their hairshooting their shafts and arrows from  beautiful eyes beyond          compareoverpowering and transpiercing  every froward adversairesharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright and temple locks like the scorpions tail and she was perfect in essence and attributes as the poet said of her in these coupletsshe beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance  and her            straight slender stature enshamed the lanceshe burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red  where all manner of            beauties have habitanceand the locks on her forehead were lowering as night  whence            issues a dawn tide of happiest chancethen sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids come ye on that i may wrestle with you and gravel you ere the moon set and the dawn break so each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright and pinioned them with their girdles and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all then there turned to her an old woman who was before her and the beldam said as in wrath o strumpet cost thou glory in grounding these girls behold i am an old woman yet have i thrown them forty times so what hast thou to boast of but if thou have the strength to wrestle with me stand up that i may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels the young lady smiled at her words but she was filled with inward wrath and she jumped up and asked o my lady zat aldawahi by the truth of the messiah wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed or dost thou jest with me and she answered yea—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the fortyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the young lady asked zat aldawahi by the truth of the messiah wilt wrestle with me or dost jest and she answered yea i will wrestle with thee in very deed sharrkan looking on the while the damsel cried rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do when the old woman heard this she raged with exceeding rage and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog then she sprang to her feet whilst the damsel stood up to her and said now by the truth of the messiah i will not wrestle with thee unless i be naked mistress whore so she loosed her petticoat trousers and putting her hand under her clothes tore them off her body then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head if ritah or a spotted snake with this she inclined towards the damsel and said do thou as i have done all this time sharrkan was gazing at the twain and laughing at the beldams loathly semblance so the damsel leisurely rose and taking a sash of yamani stuff passed it twice round her waist then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal smooth and rounded and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples as it were a bed of nuumans anemones and breasts like double pomegranates then the old woman leant towards her and the two laid hold either of each while sharrkan raised his head heavenwards and prayed allah that the belle might beat the beldam presently the young woman get beneath the old woman and gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand hoisted her off the ground with both whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and in so doing fell on her back arsiversy with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine furthermore she let fly two great farts one of which blew up the dust from the earths face and the other steamed up to the gate of heaven sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground then he arose and baring his brand looked right and left but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back and said to himself he lied not who named thee lady of calamities verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others so he drew near them to hear what should pass between them then the young lady went up to the old one and throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying o my lady zat al dawahi i intended only to throw thee and not all this but thou triedst to twist out of my hands so laud to allah for safety she returned her no answer but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned with the fair damsel standing amongst them quoth sharrkan to himself every luck hath its cause sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me so he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled him on when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath which he brandished shouting the while his war cry allah is all mighty when the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and taking firm stand on the bank of the stream whose breadth was six ells the normal cubits made one bound and landed clear on the farther side where she turned and cried out with a loud voice who art thou o thou fellow that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host whence camest thou and whither art thou going speak sooth for truth will stand thee in good stead and lie not for lies come of villein breed doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies for thou art now in an open plain and did we shout but a single shout would come to our rescue four thousand knights so tell me what thou wantest and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road we will do so when sharrkan heard her words he replied i am a stranger of the moslems who fared forth this night single handed seeking for spoil nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens so i shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them quoth she i would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it and as for the handmaids by allah they shall never be thy spoil have i not told thee that to lie is villein vile quoth he the wise man is he who taketh warning by others thereupon quoth she by the truth of the messiah did i not fear that thy death would be on my hands i would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might but i take pity upon the stranger so if thou seek booty i require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me by thy faith that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand and we will wrestle i and thou if thou throw me set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty but if i throw thee thou shalt become under my command swear this to me for i fear thy treachery indeed it hath become a common saw where perfidy is innate there trust is a weakly mate now an thou wilt swear i will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee answered sharrkan and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul truly she knoweth not that i am a champion of champions swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding and i will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest draw near that i wrestle with thee if thou throw me i have money where withal to ransom myself and if i throw thee twill be booty and booty enough for me rejoined the damsel i am content herewith and sharrkan was astounded at her words and said and by the truth of the apostle whom allah bless and keep i too am content on the other part then said she swear to me by him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling else mayst thou die without the pale of al islam sharrkan replied by allah were a kazi to swear me even though he were a kazi of the kazis he would not impose upon me such an oath as this then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree but he was drowned in the sea of thought saying in himself praise be to him who fashioned her from dirty water then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling and said to her cross the stream to me but she replied it is not for me to come over to thee if thou wilt pass thou over here to me i cannot do that quoth he and quoth she o boy i will come across to thee so she tucked up her skirts and leaping landed on the other side of the stream by his side whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms but he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness for he saw a shape which the hand of power had tanned with the dye leaves of the jann which had been fostered by the hand of beneficence and fanned by the zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted then she called out to him o moslem come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd which illumined the whole place with its whiteness and sharrkan was dazzled by it then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge she doing the like and caught hold of her and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle breeding languishment and he fell a trembling like the persian reed in the roaring gale so she lifted him up and throwing him to the ground sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand for his soul had lost mastery over his senses then she asked him o moslem the slaying of nazarenes is lawful to you folk what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself and he answered o my lady thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful for our prophet mohammed whom allah bless and preserve prohibited the slaying of women and children old men and monks as it was thus revealed to your prophet she replied it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy so rise i give thee thy life for generosity is never lost upon the generous then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib even women and she said to him be not ashamed but verily one who entereth the land of roum in quest of booty and cometh to assist kings against kings how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib twas not for lack of strength in me he answered nor didst thou throw me by thy force it was thy loveliness overthrew me so if thou wilt grant me another bout it will be of thy courtesy she laughed and said i grant thee thy request but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary and it were only right i should loose them for haply this next wrestling bout will be long then she went to the slave girls and unbinding them said to them in the tongue of greece get ye to some safe place till i foil this moslems lust and longing for you so they went away whilst sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers but when he felt waist touch waist his strength failed him and she waxing ware of this lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding levenflash and threw him to the ground he fell on his back and then she said to him rise i give thee thy life a second time i spared thee in the first count because of thy prophet for that he made unlawful the slaying of women and i do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood but i charge thee if there be in the moslem army sent by omar bin alnuuman to succour the king of constantinople a stronger than thou send him hither and tell him of me for in wrestling there are shifts and trips catches and holds such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip the hug the feetcatch the thigh lite the jostle and the leglock by allah o my lady quoth sharrkan and indeed he was highly incensed against her had i been master alsafdí master mohammed kimál or ibn alsaddí as they were in their prime i had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest for o my mistress by allah thou hast not grassed me by thy strength but by the blandishments of thy back parts for we men of mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight but now an thou wish thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three moreover i have regained my presence of mind when she heard his words she said to him hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling o vanquished one however come on an thou wilt but know that this must be the last round then she bent forward and challenged him and sharrkan did lik

Ada,Sonu Nigam,2005,there lived once in the city of cufa a man called alrabía bin hátim who was one of the chief men of the town a wealthy and a healthy and heaven had vouchsafed him a son whom he named niamah allah one day being in the slavebrokers mart he saw a woman exposed for sale with a little maid of wonderful beauty and grace on her arm so he beckoned to the broker and asked him how much for this woman and her daughter he answered fifty dinars quoth alrabia write the contract of sale and take the money and give it to her owner then he gave the broker the price and his brokerage and taking the woman and her child carried them to his house now when the daughter of his uncle who was his wife saw the slave she said to her husband o my cousin what is this damsel he replied of a truth i bought her for the sake of the little one on her arm for know that when she groweth up there will not be her like for beauty either in the land of the arabs or the ajams his wife remarked right was thy rede and said to the woman what is thy name she replied o my lady my name is tauflík and what is thy daughters name asked she answered the slave saad the happy rejoined her mistress thou sayst sooth thou art indeed happy and happy is he who hath bought thee then quoth she to her husband o my cousin what wilt thou call her and quoth he whatso thou chooses so she said then let us call her naomi and he rejoined good is thy device the little naomi was reared with alrabias son niamah in one cradle so to speak till the twain reached the age of ten and each grew handsomer than the other and the boy used to address her o my sister and she o my brother till they came to that age when alrabia said to niamah o my son naomi is not thy sister but thy slave i bought her in thy name whilst thou wast yet in the cradle so call her no more sister from this day forth quoth niamah if that be so i will take her to wife then he went to his mother and told her of this and she said to him o my son she is thy handmaid so he wedded and went in unto naomi and loved her and two years passed over them whilst in this condition nor was there in all cufa a fairer girl than naomi or a sweeter or a more graceful as she grew up she learnt the koran and read works of science and excelled in music and playing upon all kinds of instruments and in the beauty of her singing she surpassed all the folk of her time now one day as she sat with her husband in the wine chamber she took the lute tightened the strings and sang these two coupletswhile thourt my lord whose bountys my estate  a sword             whereby my woes to annihilaterecourse i never need to amru or zayd  nor aught save             thee if way to me grow straitniamah was charmed with these verses and said to her by my life o naomi sing to us with the tambourine and other instruments so she sang these couplets to a lively measureby his life who holds my guiding rein i swear  ill meet on             love ground parlous foe nor caregood sooth ill vex revilers thee obey  and quit my slumbers             and all joy forswearand for thy love ill dig in vitals mine  a grave nor shall my             vitals weet tis thereand niamah exclaimed heaven favoured art thou o naomi but whilst they led thus the most joyous life behold alhajjáj the viceroy of cufa said to himself needs must i contrive to take this girl named naomi and send her to the commander of the faithful abd almalik bin marwán for he hath not in his palace her like for beauty and sweet singing so he summoned an old woman of the duennas of his wives and said to her go to the house of alrabia and foregather with the girl naomi and combine means to carry her off for her like is not to be found on the face of the earth she promised to do his bidding the next morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devotee and hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand and henting in hand a staff and a leather water bottle of yamani manufacture— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the two hundred and thirtyeighth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the old woman promised to do the bidding of alhajjaj and whenas it was morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devotee and hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand and hent in hand a staff and a leather water bottle of yamani manufacture and fared forth crying glory be to allah praised be allah there is no god but the god allah is most great there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great nor did she leave off her lauds and her groaning in prayer whilst her heart was full of guile and wiles till she came to the house of niamah bin alrabia at the hour of noon prayer and knocked at the door the doorkeeper opened and said to her what dost thou want quoth she i am a poor pious woman whom the time of noon prayer hath overtaken and fief would i pray in this blessed place answered the porter o old woman this is no mosque nor oratory but the house of niamah son of al rabia she replied i know there is neither cathedralmosque nor oratory like the house of niamah bin alrabia i am a chamberwoman of the palace of the prince of true believers and am come out for worship and the visitation of holy places but the porter rejoined thou canst not enter and many words passed between them till at last she caught hold and hung to him saying shall the like of me be denied admission to the house of niamah bin alrabia i who have free access to the houses of emirs and grandees anon out came niamah and hearing their loud language laughed and bade the old woman enter after him so she followed him into the presence of naomi whom she saluted after the godliest and goodliest fashion and when she looked on her she was confounded at her exceeding seemliness and said to her o my lady i commend thee to the safeguard of allah who made thee and thy lord fellows in beauty and loveliness then she stood up in the prayer niche and betook herself to inclination and prostration and prayer till day departed and night darkened and starkened when naomi said to her o my mother rest thy legs and feet awhile replied the old woman o my lady whoso seeketh the world to come let him weary him in this world and whoso wearieth not himself in this world shall not attain the dwellings of the just in the world to come then naomi brought her food and said to her eat of my bread and pray heaven to accept my penitence and to have mercy on me but she cried o my lady i am fasting as for thee thou art but a girl and it befitteth thee to eat and drink and make merry allah be indulgent to thee for the almighty saith all shall be punished except him who shall repent and believe and shall work a righteous work so naomi continued sitting with the old woman in talk and presently said to niamah o my lord conjure this ancient dame to sojourn with us awhile for piety and devotion are imprinted on her countenance quoth he set apart for her a chamber where she may say her prayers and suffer no one to go in to her peradventure allah extolled and exalted be he shall prosper us by the blessing of her presence and never separate us so the old woman passed her night in praying and reciting the koran and when allah caused the morn to dawn she went in to niamah and naomi and giving them good morning said to them i pray allah have you in his holy keeping quoth naomi whither away o my mother my lord hath bidden me set apart for thee a chamber where thou mayst seclude thee for thy devotions replied the old woman allah give him long life and continue his favour to you both but i would have you charge the doorkeeper not to stay my coming in to you and inshallah i will go the round of the holy places and pray for you two at the end of my devotions every day and night then she went out whilst naomi wept for parting with her knowing not the cause of her coming and returned to alhajjaj who said to her as thou do my bidding soon thou shalt have of me abundant good quoth she i ask of thee a full month and quoth he take the month thereupon the old hag fell to daily visiting niamahs house and frequented his slavewife naomi— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the two hundred and thirtyninth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the old hag fell to visiting daily niamahs house and frequenting his slave wife naomi and both ceased not to honour her and she used to go in to them morning and evening and all in the house respected her till one day being alone with naomi she said to her o my lady by allah when i go to the holy places i will pray for thee and i only wish thou wert with me that thou mightest look on the elders of the faith who resort thither and they should pray for thee according to thy desire naomi cried i conjure thee by allah take me with thee and she replied ask leave of thy mother in law and i will take thee so naomi said to her husbands mother o my lady ask my master to let us go forth me and thee one day with this my old mother to prayer and worship with the fakirs in the holy places now when niamah came in and sat down the old woman went up to him and would have kissed his hand but he forbade her so she invoked blessings on him and left the house next day she came again in the absence of niamah and she addressed naomi saying we prayed for thee yesterday but arise now and divert thyself and return ere thy lord come home so naomi said to her motherinlaw i beseech thee for allahs sake give me leave to go with this pious woman that i may sight the saints of allah in the holy places and return speedily ere my lord come back quoth niamahs mother i fear lest thy lord know but said the old woman by allah i will not let her take seat on the floor no she shall look standing on her feet and not tarry so she took the damsel by guile and carrying her to alhajjajs palace told him of her coming after placing her in a lonely chamber whereupon he went in to her and looking upon her saw her to be the loveliest of the people of the day never had he beheld her like now when naomi caught sight of him she veiled her face from him but he left her not till he had called his chamberlain whom he commanded to take fifty horsemen and he bade him mount the damsel on a swift dromedary and bear her to damascus and there deliver her to the commander of the faithful abd almalik bin marwan moreover he gave him a letter for the caliph saying bear him this letter and bring me his answer and hasten thy return to me so the chamberlain without losing time took the damsel and she tearful for separation from her lord and setting out with her on a dromedary gave not over journeying till he reached damascus there he sought audience of the commander of the faithful and when it was granted the chamberlain delivered the damsel and reported the circumstance the caliph appointed her a separate apartment and going into his harim said to his wife al hajjaj hath bought me a slavegirl of the daughters of the kings of cufa for ten thousand dinars and hath sent me this letter— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the two hundred and fortieth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the caliph acquainted his wife with the story of the slavegirl she said to him allah increase to thee his favour then the caliphs sister went in to the supposed slavegirl and when she saw her she said by allah not unlucky is the man who hath thee in his house were thy cost an hundred thousand dinars and naomi replied o fair of face what kings palace is this and what is the city she answered this is the city of damascus and this is the palace of my brother the commander of the faithful abd almalik bin marwan then she resumed didst thou not know all this naomi said by allah o my lady i had no knowledge of it when the other asked and he who sold thee and took thy price did he not tell thee that the caliph had bought thee now when naomi heard these words she shed tears and said to herself verily i have been tricked and the trick hath succeeded adding to herself if i speak none will credit me so i will hold my peace and take patience for i know that the relief of allah is near then she bent her head for shame and indeed her cheeks were tanned by the journey and the sun so the caliphs sister left her that day and returned to her on the morrow with clothes and necklaces of jewels and dressed her after which the caliph came in to her and sat down by her side and his sister said to him look on this handmaid in whom allah hath conjoined every perfection of beauty and loveliness so he said to naomi draw back the veil from thy face but she would not unveil and he beheld not her face however he saw her wrists and love of her entered his heart and he said to his sister i will not go in unto her for three days till she be cheered by thy converse then he arose and left her but naomi ceased not to brood over her case and sigh for her separation from her master niamah till she fell sick of a fever during the night and ate not nor drank and her favour faded and her charms were changed they told the caliph of this and her condition grieved him so he visited her with physicians and men of skill but none could come at a cure for her this is how it fared with her but as regards niamah when he returned home he sat down on his bed and cried ho naomi but she answered not so he rose in haste and called out yet none came to him as all the women in the house had hidden themselves for fear of him then he went out to his mother whom he found sitting with her cheek on her hand and said to her o my mother where is naomi she answered o my son she is with one who is worthier than i to be trusted with her namely the devout old woman she went forth with her to visit devotionally the fakirs and return quoth niamah since when hath this been her habit and at what hour went she forth quoth his mother she went out early in the morning he asked and how camest thou to give her leave for this and she answered o my son twas she persuaded me there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great exclaimed niamah and going forth from his home in a state of distraction he repaired to the captain of the watch to whom said he doss thou play tricks upon me and stealmy slavegirl away from my house i will assuredly complain of thee to the commander of the faithful said the chief of police who hath taken her and niamah replied an old woman of such and such a mien clad in woollen raiment and carrying a rosary of beads numbered by thousands rejoined the other find me the old woman and i will get thee back thy slavegirl and who knows the old woman retorted niamah and who knows the hidden things save allah may he be extolled and exalted cried the chief who knew her for alhajjajs procuress cried niamah i look to thee for my slavegirl and alhajjaj shall judge between thee and me and the master of police answered go to whom thou wilt so niamah went to the palace of alhajjaj for his father was one of the chief men of cufa and when he arrived there the chamberlain went in to the governor and told him the case whereupon alhajjaj said hither with him and when he stood before him enquired what be thy business said niamah such and such things have befallen me and the governor said bring me the chief of police and we will commend him to seek for the old woman now he knew that the chief of police was acquainted with her so when he came he said to him i wish thee to make search for the slavegirl of niamah son of alrabia and he answered none knoweth the hidden things save almighty allah rejoined alhajjaj there is no help for it but thou send out horsemen and look for the damsel in all the roads and seek for her in the towns—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the two hundred and fortyfirst nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that alhajjaj said to the captain of the watch there is no help for it but thou send out horsemen and look for the damsel on all the roads and seek for her in the towns then he turned to niamah and said to him and thy slavegirl return not i will give thee ten slavegirls from my house and ten from that of the chief of police and he again bade the captain of the watch go and seek for the girl so he went out and niamah returned home full of trouble and despairing of life for he had now reached the age of fourteen and there was yet no hair on his side cheeks so he wept and lamented and shut himself up from his household and ceased not to weep and lament he and his mother till the morning when his father came in to him and said o my son of a truth alhajjaj hath put a cheat upon the damsel and hath taken her but from hour to hour allah giveth relief however grief redoubled on niamah so that he knew not what he said nor knew he who came in to him and he fell sick for three months his charms were changed his father despaired of him and the physicians visited him and said there is no remedy for him save the damsel now as his father was sitting one day behold he heard tell of a skillful persian physician whom the folk gave out for perfect in medicine and astrology and geomancy so alrabia sent for him and seating him by his side entreated him with honour and said to him look into my sons case thereupon quoth he to niamah give me thy hand the young man gave him his hand and he felt his pulse and his joints and looked in his face then he laughed and turning to his father said thy sons sole ailment is one of the heart he replied thou sayest sooth o sage but apply thy skill to his state and case and acquaint me with the whole thereof and hide naught from me of his condition quoth the persian of a truth he is enamoured of a slavegirl and this slavegirl is either in bassorah or damascus and there is no remedy for him but reunion with her said alrabia an thou bring them together thou shalt live all thy life in wealth and delight answered the persian in good sooth this be an easy matter and soon brought about and he turned to niamah and said to him no hurt shall befall thee so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear then quoth he to alrabia bring me out four thousand dinars of your money so he gave them to him and he added i wish to carry thy son with me to damascus and almighty allah willing i will not return thence but with the damsel then he turned to the youth and asked what is thy name and he answered niamah quoth the persian o niamah sit up and be of good heart for allah will reunite thee with the damsel and when he sat up the leach continued be of good cheer for we set out for damascus this very day put thy trust in the lord and eat and drink and be cheerful so as to fortify thyself for travel upon this the persian began making preparation of all things needed such as presents and rarities and he took of alrabia in all the sum of ten thousand dinars together with horses and camels and beasts of burden and other requisites then niamah farewelled his father and mother and journeyed with the physician to aleppo they could find no news of naomi there so they fared on to damascus where they abode three days after which the persian took a shop and he adorned even the shelves with vessels of costly porcelain with covers of silver and with gildings and stuffs of price moreover he set before himself vases and flagons of glass full of all manner of ointments and ups and he surrounded them with cups of crystal—and placing astrolabe and geomantic tablet facing him he donned a physicians habit and took his seat in the shop then he set niamah standing before him clad in a shirt and gown of silk and girding his middle with a silken kerchief goldembroidered said to him o niamah henceforth thou art my son so call me naught but sire and i will call thee naught but son and he replied i hear and i obey thereupon the people of damascus flocked to the persians shop that they might gaze on the youths goodliness and the beauty of the shop and its contents whilst the physician spoke to niamah in persian and he answered him in the same tongue for he knew the language after the wont of the sons of the notables so that persian doctor soon became known among the townsfolk and they began to acquaint him with their ailments and he to prescribe for them remedies moreover they brought him the water of the sick in phials and he would test it and say he whose water this is is suffering from such and such a disease and the patient would declare verily this physician sayeth sooth so he continued to do the occasions of the folk and they to flock to him till his fame spread throughout the city and into the houses of the great now one day as he sat in hisshop behold there came up an old woman riding on an ass with a stuffed saddle of brocade embroidered with jewels and stopping before the persians shop drew rein and beckoned him saying take my hand he took her hand and she alighted and asked him art thou the persian physician from irak yes answered he and she said know that i have a sick daughter then she brought out to him a phial—and the persian looked at it and said to her o my mistress tell me thy daughters name that i may calculate her horoscope and learn the hour in which it will befit her to drink medicine she replied o my brother the persian her name is naomi— and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the two hundred and fortysecond nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the persian heard the name of naomi he fell to calculating and writing on his hand and presently said o my lady i cannot prescribe a medicine for her till i know what country woman she is because of the difference of climate so tell me in what land she was brought up and what is her age the old woman replied she is fourteen years old and she was brought up in cufa of irak he asked and how long hath she sojourned in this country but a few months answered she now when niamah heard the old womans words and recognised the name of his slave girl his heart fluttered and he was like to faint then said the persian such and such medicines will suit her case and the old woman rejoined then make them up and give me what thou hast mentioned with the blessing of almighty allah so saying she threw upon the shop board ten gold pieces and he looked at niamah and bade him prepare the necessary drugs whereupon she also looked at the youth and exclaimed allah have thee in his keeping o my son verily she favoureth thee in age and mien then said she to the physician o my brother the persian is this thy slave or thy son he is my son answered he so niamah put up the medicine and placing it in a little box took a piece of paper and wrote thereon these two coupletsif naomi bless me with a single glance  let suadá sue and             juml joy tothey said forget her twenty such thoult find  but none is             like her—i will not forgethe pressed the paper into the box and sealing it up wrote upon the cover the following words in cufic characters i am niamah of alrabia of cufa then he set it before the old woman who took it and bade them farewell and returned to the caliphs palace and when she went up with the drugs to the damsel she placed the little box of medicine at her feet saying o my lady know that there is lately come to our town a persian physician than whom i never saw a more skilful nor a better versed in matters of malady i told him thy name after showing him the waterbottle and forthwith he knew thine ailment and prescribed a remedy then he bade his son make thee up this medicine and there is not in damascus a comelier or a seemlier youth than this lad of his nor hath anyone a shop the like of his shop so naomi took the box and seeing the names of her lord and his father written on the cover changed colour and said to herself doubtless the owner of this shop is come in search of me so she said to the old woman describe to me this youth answered the old woman his name is niamah he hath a mole on his right eyebrow is richly clad and is perfectly handsome cried naomi give me the medicine whereon be the blessing and help of almighty allah so she drank off the potion and she laughing and said indeed it is a blessed medicine then she sought in the box and finding the paper opened it read it understood it and knew that this was indeed her lord whereas her heart was solaced and she rejoiced now when the old woman saw her laughing she exclaimed this is indeed a blessed day and naomi said o nurse i have a mind for something to eat and drink the old woman said to the serving women bring a tray of dainty viands for your mistress whereupon they set food before her and she sat down to eat and behold in came the caliph who seeing her sitting at meat rejoiced and the old woman said to him o commander of the faithful i give thee joy of thy hand maid naomis recovery and the cause is that there is lately come to this our city a physician than whom i never saw a better versed in diseases and their remedies i fetched her medicine from him and she hath drunken of it but once and is restored to health quoth he take a thousand dinars and apply thyself to her treatment till she be completely recovered and he went away rejoicing in the damsels recovery whilst the old woman betook herself to the persians house and delivered the thousand dinars giving him to know that she was become the caliphs slave and also handing him a letter which naomi had written he took it and gave the letter to niamah who at first sight knew her hand and fell down in a swoon when he revived he opened the letter and found these words written therein from the slave despoiled of her niamah her delight her whose reason hath been beguiled and who is parted from the core of her heart but afterwards of a truth thy letter hath reached me and hath broadened my breast and solaced my soul even as saith the poetthy note came long lost hungers wrote that note  till drop             they sweetest scents for what they wrotetwas moses to his mothers arms restored  twas jacobs eye             sight cured by josephs coatwhen niamah read these verses his eyes ran over with tears and the old woman said to him what maketh thee to weep o my son allah never cause thine eye to shed tears cried the persian o my lady how should my son not weep seeing that this is his slavegirl and he her lord niamah son of alrabia of cufa and her health dependeth on her seeing him for naught aileth her but loving him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the two hundred and fortythird nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian cried out to the old woman how shall my son not weep seeing that this is his slavegirl and he her lord niamah son of alrabia of cufa and the health of this damsel dependeth on her seeing him and naught aileth her but loving him so do thou o my lady take these thousand dinars to thyself and thou shalt have of me yet more than this only look on us with eyes of rush for we know not how to bring this affair to a happy end save through thee then she said to niamah say art thou indeed her lord he replied yes and she rejoined thou sayest sooth for she ceaseth not continually to name thee then he told her all that had passed from first to last and she said o youth thou shalt owe thy reunion with her to none but myself so she mounted and at once returning to naomi looked in her face and laughed saying it is just o my daughter that thou weep and fall sick for thy separation from thy master niamah son of alrabia of cufa quoth naomi verily the veil hath been withdrawn for thee and the truth revealed to thee rejoined the old woman be of good cheer and take heart for i will assuredly bring you together though it cost me my life then she returned to niamah and said to him i went to thy slave girl and conversed with her and i find that she longeth for thee yet more than thou for her for although the commander of the faithful is minded to become intimate with her she refuseth herself to him but if thou be stout of purpose and firm of heart i will bring you together and venture my life for you and play some trick and make shift to carry thee into the caliphs palace where thou shalt meet her for she cannot come forth and niamah answered allah requite thee with good then she took leave of him and went back to naomi and said thy lord is indeed dying of love for thee and would fain see thee and foregather with thee what sayest thou naomi replied and i too am longing for his sight and dying for his love whereupon the old woman took a parcel of womens clothes and ornaments and repairing to niamah said to him come with me into some place apart so he brought her into the room behind the shop where she stained his hands and decked his wrists and plaited his hair after which she clad him in a slavegirls habit and adorned him after the fairest fashion of womans adornment till he was as one of the houris of the garden of heaven and when she saw him thus she exclaimed blessed be allah best of creators by allah thou art handsomer than the damsel now walk with thy left shoulder forwards and thy right well behind and sway thy hips from side to side so he walked before her as she bade him and when she saw he had caught the trick of womans gait she said to him expect me tomorrow night and allah willing i will take and carry thee to the palace but when thou seest the chamberlains and the eunuchs be bold and bow thy head and speak not with any for i will prevent their speech and with allah is success accordingly when the morning dawned she returned and carrying him to the palace entered before him and he after her step by step the chamberlain would have stopped his entering but the old woman said to him o most ill omened of slaves this is the handmaid of naomi the caliphs favourite how durst thou stay her when she would enter then said she come in o damsel and the old woman went in and they ceased not faring on till they drew near the door leading to the inner piazza of the palace when she said to him o niamah hearten thyself and take courage and enter and turn to the left then count five doors and pass through the sixth for it is that of the place prepared for thee fear nothing and if any speak to thee answer not neither stop then she went up with him to the door and the chamberlain there on guard accosted her saying what damsel is this—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the two hundred and fortyfourth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the chamberlain accosted the old woman saying what damsel is this quoth the ancient dame our lady hath a mind to buy her and he rejoined none may enter save by leave of the commander of the faithful so do thou go back with her i can not let her pass for thus am i commanded replied the old woman o chief chamberlain use thy reason thou knowest that naomi the caliphs slavegirl of whom he is enamoured is but now restored to health and the commander of the faithful hardly yet crediteth her recovery she is minded to buy this ha

Saturday Saturday,Indeep Bakshi,2010,previously on serial…jayhe left his cell phone in the car with me told me he’d call medetective ritzand now at this point do you know why he’s leaving the car with youjayyesdetective ritzand why is thatjaybecause he said he’s going to kill haeadnan syedi definitely understand that someone could look at this and say “oh you know he must be lying it’s so coincidental”nishahe told me to speak with jay and i was like “ok” because jay wanted to say hi so i said hi to jay and that’s all i can really recallsarah koenigthe uselessness of what we’re trying to do by recreating something that doesn’t fit it’s like trying to plot the coordinates of someone’s dream or somethingadnan syedyou know perhaps i’ll never be able to explain it and it is what it is if someone believes me or not i have no control over itautomated voicethis is a globaltel link prepaid call from adnan syed an inmate at a maryland correctional facility this call will be recorded and monitored if you wish tosarah koenigfrom this american life and wbez chicago it’s serial one story told week by week and this episode twelve is the final week final episode of season one of this podcastit’s been a year since i first contacted adnan and i’m still talking to him regularly i’m still asking him the basics still thinking i dunno that he’ll remember something or maybe he’ll just get so frustrated with me that he’ll cracki still want to know what you were doing that afternoon i want to know who had your phone and i want to know what you were doing that afternoonadnan syedi don’t remember anything moresarah koenigthis is from saturday night just this past saturday i mean we’re down to the wire hereoh manadnan syedso you don’t really have if you don’t mind me asking you don’t really have no ending like it’s justsarah koenigi mean do i have an ending umof course i have an ending we’re going to come to an ending today plus a smattering of new information a review of old information cast under a different light and an ending in case you haven’t noticed my thoughts about adnan’s case about who is lying and why have not been fixed over the course of this story several times i have landed on a decision i’ve made up my mind and stayed there with relief and then inevitably i learn something i didn’t know before and i’m up ended sometimes the reversal takes a few weeks sometimes it happens within hours and what’s been astonishing to me is how the back and forth hasn’t let up after all of this time even into this very week and i kid you not into this very day that i’m writing this because i’m learning new information all the timefor instance i talked to don eight months ago he told me he did not want to talk to me for this story and then last week he talked to me for this story he didn’t want me to use tape of his voice or his last name but he said i could use what he said spoiler here don does not appear to know what happened to hae or why it happened to her or whether adnan is guilty but it was interesting to hear what he said he remembered about the day hae disappeared and about her and about the trial here’s what he told me don said hae was at his house in a town north of baltimore city on the night of january 12 the night before she went missing he said she wanted to spend the whole next day with him too she wanted him to call woodlawn high school and pretend to be some authority figure tell the office hae couldn’t be in school that day she wanted it to be an excused absence rather than just plain hooky but he didn’t he says he thought she should go to school and besides he told her he had to work the next day at 9am it was supposed to be his day off from the lenscrafters at the owings mills mall where they both worked but don said he arranged to fill in for a friend at the store in hunt valley don said he and hae had made plans to meet up later that night of the 13th after her work shift ended at 10 pm when the cops recovered hae’s car there was a note inside with don’s name on it “hey cutie sorry i couldn’t stay i have to go to a wrestling match at randelstown high but i promise to page you as soon as i get home ok till then take care and drive safely always hae” in a ps on the note hae mentions a tv interview that had been taped that day the local station had done a student athlete segment on her so the note was written on the 13th the day she went missing this note was one of the reasons i’d initially written to don way back when “sorry i couldn’t stay” is confusing i didn’t understand what she’d planned to do with the note put it on his car maybe but his car was so far away in hunt valley but the note stumped don too he said he didn’t know about it until i sent it to him and he didn’t have a guess as to what her plan was for that afternoon when hae went missing don was one of the first people the cops called he says he knew immediately he’d be a suspect he said “that was the first thought when they said she’s missing i said ‘well ok they’re going to try to blame it on me because she was with me last night i’m the new boyfriend i’m obviously going to be one of the first suspects me and adnan’” he said he immediately made sure he knew where he was “when someone calls you up and tells you ‘have you seen this person they went missing they haven’t been seen since school’ you automatically retrace everything you did that day did i see them did i hear from them did they page me did they call me where was i at this time what was i doing at that time yeah”maybe you’re all noting as i did that that wasn’t adnan’s stated reaction to getting called by the cops on the 13th i’m tempted to make a judgment right here but i’m going to pull a benefit of the doubt because adnan was seventeen he was stoned he’s a different person but noted right also note however there was one similarity in how they reacted to hae’s disappearance you know how adnan says he doesn’t remember calling hae after the 13th guess who else doesn’t remember trying to call hae after the 13th  don like everyone else he said he wondered whether maybe she’d gone to california she’d told him her father lived there he says it’s not that he didn’t think about what had happened or didn’t worry it’s just that he didn’t know what to do don’s alibi was solid his computer generated time card said he’d arrived at work at 902 am on the 13th taken lunch from 110 to 142 clocked out at 6 pm but don’s manager at the hunt valley store was his mom so that didn’t look great don said he was anxious throughout the investigation“they never up until the day they arrested adnan i had no idea what was going on” he said “they never said you’re cleared as a suspect it was left hanging and until they arrested him i had no idea i suspected they might try to say we were in on it together i didn’t know jay existed until i started listening to the podcast”don had met adnan once according to hae’s diary it was december 23 it was a snowy day and she had a minor car accident on the way into work and she’d called adnan to come help her out they were broken up by this time but he came to the rescue in the parking lot outside lenscrafters adnan and don converged hae writes “don and adnan took a look at my car and told me not to drive it unanimously ah mommy is going to be so mad but i swear it’s not my fault”don told the cops back then that he and adnan had a perfectly nice conversation at trial he said adnan said something to him like “ok well i just want to make sure you’re an ok guy” don told me the same “we sat and talked and just as everyone else described him he was very polite articulate just really the typical what you’d expect of the exboyfriend meeting the new boyfriend sizing each other up we joked we spent a good 1015 minutes talking after we checked out the car” at trial for whatever reason this episode is firmly timestamped as having happened in january after hae and don had started dating though it’s clear from the diary it was december 23rd in any case don’s testimony at both trials he’s the state’s witness is milquetoast he just says “yeah i met him it was cordial” which made me wonder why the state even called don and according to don prosecutor kevin urick might have been wondering the same thing don said “when i testified they pulled me in a back room and let me tell you how fun that was to have the prosecutor afterwards yelling at me because i did not make adnan sound creepy” he said “they wanted me to make him sound creepy so creepy that i felt intimidated which i did not adnan he was very personable he was funny he was everything i already said he was somebody that i would have hung out with if i knew him in school” don’s memory is that urick yelled at him after both the first and second trials “oh he was irate” don said “when i say yelling he was literally yelling about it at me” i ran this by kevin urick but he said he was not authorised to talk about the casedon says he loved hae that he still loves her it’s not something that goes away he said even though they only officially dated for thirteen days he says she meant a lot to him she was totally unshy he said confident she pursued him he said for all of december whenever she saw him at work he said she’d ask him when he was going to take her out constantly she asked him followed him into the lunch room on his break pestered him he was dating someone else at the time but then that ended and so on new year’s eve they made their first date for the next day he fell for her pretty quickly he says “you could not not like this girl she was aggressive intelligent assertive is a better word than aggressive generally nice person anything i’ve heard anybody say about her since it’s not like ‘oh i don’t want to talk bad about the dead’ it’s just being honest it’s hard for me to explain if you didn’t like her you didn’t like her because she was so likeable but then you couldn’t even be annoyed by her because she wasn’t annoying she was charming”don said hae actually changed him changed the way he thought about himself he said he’d come off a couple of bad relationships girls who had cheated on him “she basically in no uncertain terms told me to knock it off” he said “that i’m worth that i have worth i don’t remember the words she used i can’t paraphrase it at this point but i am worth having self esteem that i should think that i am good enough and i took it to heart especially after i found out that she had died”joshi’m sorry that i’m throwing it so late in the game here but i didn’t even know that this existed until fridaysarah koenigyeah that ok no that’s ok that’s okhere’s another guy i just heard from and speaking of him all of a sudden i was hearing jay’s perspective or at least this guy’s perspective of jay’s perspectivejoshhe was scared i mean like terrifiedsarah koenigthis guy’s name is josh he asked that i not use his last name he said he worked with jay at south west video the porn store josh was twentyone at the time they weren’t close friends he said but josh would give jay rides and they’d smoke weed together hang out a little bit josh said that on the night that jay was first picked up by the cops so late at night on february 27 and into the morning of the 28 jay called him at home and asked him to come into the store because he didn’t want to be alone there he was that scaredjoshhe was i mean frightened out of his mind and not of the police they were the secondary fear i mean he was afraid of going to jail but not like he was afraid of adman i guess is how you say his name i don’t knowsarah koenigadnanjoshadnan that’s itsarah koenigjosh says jay actually never told him adnan’s name but josh has listened to the podcast so he knows the name now but back then he didn’t he says jay told him he was afraid that people were after him people connected to the murdererjoshacross the street from the video store was a parking lot for the amtrak commuter trains and the parking lot was usually empty in the evening well that particular night there was a van in that parking lot which i’m pretty positive had nobody in it but jay was afraid i mean to the point he was almost in tearssarah koenigyeahjoshhe didn’t want to go outside he didn’t even want to look out the door because he really thought the van that was across the street was people waiting to get himsarah koenigbut the people you’re talking about is it only in retrospect that you’re thinking it’s adnan’s people or did he say that to you at the timejoshoh no he said it he said it was i guess adnan had threatened himsarah koenigright but you’re saying that you didn’t know he never told you the name of the person i’m just trying to imagine is it possible that it was somebody else entirely who he was afraid ofjoshyeah i guess it could have been but whoever he was afraid of is obviously the person that committed the crimesarah koenigright but so i’m saying did you did he express to you at the time that this was a person with pakistani relativesjoshyeahsarah koenigoh he did he said that at the timejoshyeah he definitely said it was somebody the guy was middle easternsarah koenigjosh says jay told him it was the exboyfriend who’d killed hae it was josh’s impression that jay had called the cops himself that night because he told josh the cops were coming to get him and he seemed anxious that it was taking them so long to get there josh says jay was pacing checking his watch that he kept asking him to look outside to see if the van was still there at trial jay testifies that the cops showed up at the video store on their own that he didn’t know they were coming in his taped interview with the police that same night february 28 jay doesn’t mention a white van or that he’s terrified of adnan’s people but he does tell the cops that he’s talked to adnan either yesterday or the day before and that adnan was threatening him in a general way here’s tape from that february 28 interview detective ritz talks firstdetective ritzwhen was the last conversation you had with adnanjayi think it was either yesterday or the day beforedetective ritzthe most recent conversation you had with him what was the content of that conversationjayi learned that you guys were looking for medetective ritzhow did you learn thatjaypeople told me friends of mine told me you guys were coming to question me so i went to him and said “what did you get me wrapped up in” and he just told me “just calm down everything will be ok”detective ritzwhere did this conversation take placejayi believe it was in front of my house in inaudible parkdetective ritzother than you saying “what the fuck did you do why did you get me wrapped up in this” what did he sayjayhe just told me “ain’t nothing that happened they don’t know shit” and “stay cool”detective ritzis there anything else said during that conversationjaypause he told me that he knew somebody pause i used to be involved in a lot of illegal activity and people on the west side basically the gist of what he told me was that he knew the west side hitman so i wouldn’t call it a threat but he was letting me knowdetective ritzin a roundabout way that if you said something to the police thatjayyeah because i told him if they come to me i ain’t going to fuck around i’m just going to tell them what the gig is and he was like “you know who i know” that’s what he said to mesarah koenigok so the west side hitman it’s so strange i find josh’s version of jay’s fear so much more believable than jay’s version of jay’s fear which makes me wonder if it’s all just in the delivery when jay first told josh weeks before that he knew something about the missing girl who was all over the news josh says he didn’t believe himjoshi said something about him not really being involved and then he’s like “no man you don’t understand i helped to bury the body” it seemed like he was kind of bragging i mean that’s kind of the guy that jay was it’s not that he bragged about stuff that he did sometimes he made up things that he didn’t do and so that’s kind of what i thought he was doing why would you say that why would you tell somebody that you really don’t know that well and i guess it’s why i didn’t believe him if i had done it i certainly wouldn’t have told mesarah koenigrightjoshmaybe my best friend or something like that but not not somebody that you work with at a porn storesarah koenigthe version of the crime that josh says jay eventually told him it’s pretty close to the version that jay’s friend chris told me too that jay was out somewhere and that adnan came to him and showed him the body and said something to the effect of “you gotta help me” josh says he can’t remember where jay said he was when this happened but he is certain the words “best buy” were never attached to the story josh went to that best buy all the time and he says he definitely would have remembered that he said when he heard in the podcast that chris had mentioned the pool hall thing that sounded right to him but he can’t say for sure josh says he also had the impression like chris that it had all gone down later in the day not mid afternoon josh says at first jay seemed afraid the cops were going to figure out he was involved through fingerprints or dna or something but that as time went on he seemed more and more afraid of the guy who did it that he was threatening stephanie it was “you’d better keep your mouth shut or else” he says jay told him the threats were getting more forceful to josh jay was so not the type to be involved in a murder maybe he tried to act tough he said but he wasn’t he said he himself had friends who got in serious fights or who’d been locked up for grand theft auto but jay was not in that category at all he said he was a nice guyjoshhe wasn’t the type of guy that you really got the sense he could do something real he wasn’t a killer and he wasn’t a thug if anything he was kind of the opposite he seemed like he was in way over his headsarah koenigyeahjoshi remember feeling bad for himsarah koenigwas there any point i mean i don’t mean to sound judgy or something but was there any point where you’re like “well you should go tell the cops then if you know who did this go tell the cops”joshno not really i know that’s probably what i should have said but i didn’t really believe him and like i said when it comes to reputation on the street you don’t want to be the guy that’s “oh go snitch” you don’t want anybody to see you’re weak and all that stuff and so i didn’t ever say go to the cops because that would be like the bitch thing to dosarah koenigjosh says what never quite made sense to him what he never entirely understood was why jay would help adnan bury haejosheven if i didn’t call the cops i definitely wouldn’t grab a shovel and help him dig a gravesarah koenigright i know i know i know that’s what’s hard about the story is that you just figure there’s something that’s not computing herejoshit definitely never sounded right which is why i never believed him until the cops actually picked him upsarah koenigjosh says he only remembers seeing jay one more time after that he thinks maybe jay came by the store to pick up his check and when josh asked him “so what happened” josh says jay told him he couldn’t talk about itin preparation for this episode julie and dana the producers of this show went back over everything we had all the police files the attorney files the interviews i’ve done the cell records they did one final sweep just to be sure we’d weighed everything and because old details can have startling new meaning after a year’s worth of research is behind us they came across a couple of things they wanted me to knowfirst and foremost the nisha call i’d asked them “is there any other viable explanation for the nisha call on adnan’s cell record” here’s juliejulie snyderwe’d always been under the impression that the nisha call was a nowayaroundit callsarah koenigit looks terrible for himjulie snyderit looks terrible for him and it’s 2 minutes and 22 secondssarah koenigto remind you the nisha call is the one that happens at 332pm on january 13 it’s to that girl that adnan has been flirting with who lived near silver spring the nisha call is the one that’s always stuck out to me and i think to most people who’ve looked at adnan’s case closely because it happens on the afternoon that hae disappeared at a time when adnan has said insisted even that he was not with his phone that jay had his phone while he was in school jay had told the detectives that adnan had called some girl in silver spring that afternoon and briefly put jay on the phone with her that’s why the call is so important not only does it put adnan together with his phone in the middle of the afternoon it puts adnan together with jay in the middle of the afternoon it corroborates jay’s story i’ve always had some suspicion about this call because nisha said to the cops and at trial that there was a day when adnan put his friend jay on the phone but nisha has consistently said it happened toward the evening at the video store where they worked jay didn’t have the video store job on january 13 he started that job at the end of the month so i never bought the idea that the thirteenth was the day she talked to jay but even so it didn’t look good for adnan because who was calling nisha in the middle of the afternoon then jay didn’t know nisha so for me this call has remained one of the pillars of the case against adnan that’s what julie means when she says “no way around it” but now i think the nisha call might be moving from the “no way around it this looks bad for adnan’ column” into “eh now i’m not so sure” adnan says that nisha’s number was programmed into his cellphone so he’s always said to me “maybe the button got pushed accidentally like a butt dial and then the answering machine picked up” the problem with that explanation besides how convenient it sounds for adnan is that there was not answering machine on that line that’s what nisha says at trial this call shows up not just on the call log but on adnan’s att bill he got charged for it so this was our quest or really dana and julie’s quest to find out is it possible that this call would have shown up on adnan’s bill even if it went unanswered this proved so elusive first we got one answer then another then another then another att was not helping us then finally dana and julie figured out exactly what they needed to answer this question an att customer service agreement circa 1999 they found one in a class action lawsuit against att that included as an exhibit the very document we neededjulie snyderluckily that class action lawsuit was filed in new york so dana was able to go down to thesarah koenigthat’s the photo you sentdana chivvisthat’s the old records department of the new york supreme court or something like that yeahsarah koenigthat’s so awesome it looked like the mad hatters archive room were you the first humanoid who’d come down in like fifteen years laughingdana chivvisyeah they were like “what news do you bring”julie snyderso dana goes down there pulls the service agreement takes pictures of the contract sends the first picture the first picture says on the contract it says “we do not bill for unanswered calls”sarah koenigohmeaning the nisha had to have been answered because it shows up on the bill but there was fine print to the fine print when dana flipped through to the last page of the contract she found a loophole the loophole says att won’t charge for unanswered calls unless the call isn’t terminated within a “reasonable time” so if you call someone and it rings and rings and you don’t hang up within a “reasonable time” att will charge you for that call even if it’s unanswered so what is a reasonable amount of time or rather an unreasonable amount of time that loophole actually still exists today and the unreasonable amount of time today is thirty seconds or longer they’ll charge we saw one contract from ‘99 that specified sixty seconds or longer so it stands to reason that two minutes were probably covered they probably did charge the folks at att told us the only reason a contract would have varied back then in ‘99 was if the state had passed particular legislation to address it we didn’t find anything in the maryland rules about it so after all this work we feel pretty confident that att would have charged for a call that rang and rang for more than two minutes in maryland in 1999so either way if it’s two minutes and twentytwo seconds it’s probably unreasonablejulie snyderit’s probably unreasonabledana chivvisthat seems unreasonablesarah koenigit an unreasonable amount of time to be listening to a phone ring i gotta say without it being answered so laughsjulie snyderit’s an unreasonable amount of work going in trying to figure this out laughssarah koenigi know that’s a long and perhaps way too detailed way of explaining it but all this adds up to something important it means the nisha call could conceivably have been a butt dial that no one answered it means there isn’t only one explanation for the nisha call there are alternative scenarios it could be that adnan called nisha or it could be that jay was with somebody else who called nisha or maybe jay or someone else called nisha by accident a butt dial and no one was ever the wiser because no one ever picked up if there are alternative scenarios then that means the list of things we know actually definitively know facts we can show about the evidence against adnan that list just got shorterin a way the only hard evidence in the case against adnan is his cellphone record for january 13 that’s what the cops and prosecutor used to corroborate jay’s statements so dana and julie looked at that same record all over again the call log and the cell tower map teased it all apart to see if they could figure out what happened to figure out if there was anything else i could know about what jay and adnan were doing that day we’ve talked about the call log a lot already we already knew it didn’t match jay’s explanations of where they went and when but when julie looked again she realized when she tried to assign the calls some semblance of a narrative her picture of the day crumbled even more instead of answering any of her questions the call log raised bigger ones such as was everyone lying about that daymy original question going into this whole endeavour this whole story was either jay’s lying or adnan’s lying but what if it’s not either or what if it’s both and the call log evidence is screwy right from the beginning jay said that when he met up that morning when adnan drove over to jay’s to give him his car they’d gone shopping at the mall adnan has said various things but not that they went shopping what seems most likely according to what adnan told his attorney at the time is that adnan hung out with jay until about 1245100 pm and then went back to school there’s a 1207 call and a 1241 call the first pings a tower out west in ellicott city the next pings a tower back east toward baltimore city they’re pretty far apart from each other here’s juliejulie snydergoing to ellicott city and then going into baltimore city where the phone is pinging off of edmonson avenue area which is actually near drug strips where hae’s car was dumped that sort of area of baltimore that’s not mentioned by adnan so “i don’t remember what we did i know we didn’t go shopping i’m not really sure” i feel more concerned and suspicious i feel suspicious of being like “huh” because i can see being i can see where the phone was moving i know jay’s story about security square mall is not true because of the phone if they had the phone but i don’t think adnan’s is true eitherdana chivviscan i also add that at one point jenn says to the detective that she remembers one of those phone calls she answered and talked to jay and jay had said that he was downtown with adnansarah koenigthe prosecutor at trial said “we don’t really know what they were doing but it doesn’t matter because hae was in school at that time alive” that’s true but still the phone record tells us that there’s something they’re not telling us why and is it related to what happened later the next call is the incoming 236 call the supposed “best buy” call from the phone booth that we’re pretty solidly convinced wasn’t the “come and get me” calli do have something of an update there we have not found evidence of a phone booth outside the best buy on the sidewalk like jay draws on his map for the cops but we have now seen two anecdotal reports that there was a payphone inside the vestibule we haven’t been able to verify these reports but we did get a look at the 1994 architectural plans for that best buy and indeed on the plans there is a teeny little rectangle in the vestibule on the left as you walk in labeled “payphone” so maybe there was one insideanyway back to the call log julie spent a long time thinking about the 321 call it opened a whole new mystery for her because it’s confusing on about three different levels it’s an outgoing call from adnan’s cell to jenn’s house phone jay and jenn both talk about some call that afternoon that comes into her landline someone supposedly looking for jayjulie snyderjenn says she remembers jay getting phone calls while he was at her house jay says he remembers getting phone calls while at the house both of them also reference a landline call jay says “i get a call on the landline and that’s when i leave”sarah koenigmeaning right this incoming landline call is adnan calling in looking for jayjulie snyderwhy would adnan be calling you on the landline the whole point of him giving you the cell phone was so that he could call you on the cell phone it doesn’t make any sense but there is a 321 call made from the cell phone to jenn’s housesarah koenighere’s the second confusing thing jay eventually told the cops the 321 call was a call he made to jenn asking if she knew whether this guy patrick was around jay was looking for weed from patrick jenn by the way testified this never would have happened that jay would never call her asking about patrick but anyway here’s the third thing the confusing kicker both jay and jenn also say jay was at jenn’s house until about 345 pm that dayjulie snyderthat also has always confused me if jay is at jenn’s house until 345 how is he calling jenn’s house at 321 why would he be calling the house that he’s sitting in itsarah koenigunless adnan has the phonejulie snyderunless jay doesn’t have the phone i’m not saying who has the phone i have no idea who has the phone but it leads me to believe that there is the possibility that jay doesn’t have the phonesarah koenigso what’s the evidence that jay does have the phone jenn tells the police that she saw jay with the phone that afternoon she has an image of the cell phone in her mind sitting on the coffee table at her house but at 321 the tower that’s pinged isn’t the one that covers jenn’s house if jay doesn’t have the phone though then who has the phone more to the point if jay doesn’t have the phone then what was going on that afternoon then i have no idea what was going onthere are discrepancies unresolved like this all throughout the afternoon and evening right up until the end of the night when there’s a big one we noticed it right at the beginning and while adnan’s attorney does bring it up at trial no one dwells on it too long but it’s odd jenn and jay tell different stories about where she picked him up on the night of the thirteenth and about where and when they got rid of jay’s clothes and boots jenn says she picked jay up at westview mall where she saw adnan too jay says

Phir Mohabbat,"Mohammed Irfan, Arijit, Saim Bhat",2011,there was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before a merchant who dwelt in the land of bassorah and who owned two sons and wealth galore but in due time allah the allhearing the allknowing decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the most high so he died and his two sons laid him out and buried him after which they divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion each one opened a shop presently the elder son hasan hight a youth of passing beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace betook himself to the company of lewd folk women and low boys frolicking with them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done for that he exulted in the abundance of his good after some time he had wasted all his ready money so he sold all his fathers lands and houses and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing neither little nor muchel nor was one of his comrades left who knew him he abode thus anhungred he and his widowed mother three days and on the fourth day as he walked along unknowing whither to wend there met him a man of his fathers friends who questioned him of his case he told him what had befallen him and the other said o my son i have a brother who is a goldsmith an thou wilt thou shalt be with him and learn his craft and become skilled therein hasan consented and accompanied him to his brother to whom he commended him saying in very sooth this is my son do thou teach him for my sake so hasan abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft and allah opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for himself one day as he sat in his booth in the bazar there came up to him an ajamí a foreigner a persian with a great white beard and a white turband on his head having the semblance of a merchant who after saluting him looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly it pleased him and he shook his head saying by allah thou art a cunning goldsmith what may be thy name hasan replied the other shortly the persian continued to look at his wares whilst hasan read in an old book he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace till the hour of midafternoon prayer when the shop became clear of people and the persian accosted the young man saying o my son thou art a comely youth what book is that thou hast no sire and i have no son and i know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and seventyninth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian accosted the young man saying o my son thou art a comely youth thou hast no sire and i have no son and i know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world many have sought of me instruction therein but i consented not to instruct any of them in it yet hath my soul consented that i teach it to thee for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and i will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer and anvil charcoal and fire hasan asked o my lord and when wilt thou teach me this and the persian answered tomorrow inshallah i will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of this copper whereupon hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the persian till nightfall when he took leave of him and going in to his mother saluted her with the salam and ate with her but he was dazed without memory or reason for that the strangers words had gotten hold upon his heart so she questioned him and he told her what had passed between himself and the persian which when she heard her heart fluttered and she strained him to her bosom saying o my son beware of hearkening to the talk of the folk and especially of the persians and obey them not in aught for they are sharpers and tricksters who profess the art of alchemy and swindle people and take their money and devour it in vain replied hasan o my mother we are paupers and have nothing he may covet that he should put a cheat on us indeed this persian is a right worthy shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him allah hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son she was silent in her chagrin and he passed the night without sleep his heart being full of what the persian had said to him nor did slumber visit him for the excess of his joy therein but when morning morrowed he rose and taking the keys opened the shop whereupon behold the persian accosted him hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands but he forbade him from this and suffered it not saying o hasan set on the crucible and apply the bellows so he did as the stranger bade him and lighted the charcoal then said the persian o my son hast thou any copper and he replied i have a broken platter so he bade him work the shears and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows till the copper became liquid when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper and opening it sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of somewhat like yellow kohl or eyepowder then he bade hasan blow upon it with the bellows and he did so till the contents of the crucible became a lump of gold when the youth saw this he was stupefied and at his wits end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it pure gold of the finest quality whereupon his reason fled and he was dazed with excess of delight and bent over the persians hand to kiss it but he forbade him saying art thou married and when the youth replied no he said carry this ingot to the market and sell it and take the price in haste and speak not so hasan went down into the market and gave the bar to the broker who took it and rubbed it upon the touchstone and found it pure gold so they opened the biddings at ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up to fifteen thousand dirhams at which price he sold it and taking the money went home and told his mother all that had passed saying o my mother i have learnt this art and mystery but she laughed at him saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightieth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the ajami and cried i have learnt this art and mystery she laughed at him saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great and she was silent for vexation then of his ignorance he took a metal mortar and returning to the shop laid it before the persian who was still sitting there and asked him o my son what wilt thou do with this mortar hasan answered let us put it in the fire and make of it lumps of gold the persian laughed and rejoined o my son art thou jinnmad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two ingots of gold in one day knowest thou not that the folk would suspect us and our lives would be lost now o my son an i teach thee this craft thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth for that will suffice thee from year to year cried hasan true o my lord and sitting down in his open shop set on the crucible and cast more charcoal on the fire quoth the persian what wilt thou o my son and quoth hasan teach me this craft there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great exclaimed the persian laughing verily o my son thou art little of wit and in nowise fitted for this noble craft did ever any during all his life learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars if we busy ourselves with it here the folk will say of us these practise alchemy and the magistrates will hear of us and we shall lose our lives wherefore o my son an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright come thou with me to my house so hasan barred his shop and went with that ajamí but by the way he remembered his mothers words and thinking in himself a thousand thoughts he stood still with bowed head the persian turned and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him art thou mad what i in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest i will harm thee presently adding but if thou fear to go with me to my house i will go with thee to thine and teach thee there hasan replied tis well o uncle and the persian rejoined go thou before me so hasan led the way to his own house and entering told his mother of the persians coming for he had left him standing at the door she ordered the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and adorning it her son bade her go to one of the neighbours lodgings so she left her home to them and wended her way whereupon hasan brought in the persian who entered after asking leave then he took in hand a dish and going to the market returned with food which he set before the persian saying eat o my lord that between us there may be bread and salt and may almighty allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and salt the persian replied with a smile true o my son who knoweth the virtue and worth of bread and salt then he came forward and ate with hasan till they were satisfied after which the ajami said o my son hasan bring us somewhat of sweetmeats so hasan went to the market rejoicing in his words and returned with ten saucers of sweetmeats of which they both ate and the persian said may allah abundantly requite thee o my son it is the like of thee with whom folk company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may profit him then said he o hasan bring the gear but hardly did hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass in springtide and hastening to the shop fetched the apparatus and set it before the persian who pulled out a piece of paper and said o hasan by the bond of bread and salt wert thou not dearer to me than my son i would not let thee into the mysteries of this art for i have none of the elixir left save what is in this paper but by and by i will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before thee know o my son hasan that to every ten pounds of copper thou must set half a drachm of that which is in this paper and the whole ten will presently become unalloyed virgin gold presently adding o my son o hasan there are in this paper three ounces egyptian measure and when it is spent i will make thee other and more hasan took the packet and finding therein a yellow powder finer than the first said to the persian o my lord what is the name of this substance and where is it found and how is it made but he laughed longing to get hold of the youth and replied of what dost thou question indeed thou art a froward boy do thy work and hold thy peace so hasan arose and fetching a brass platter from the house shore it in shreds and threw it into the meltingpot then he scattered on it a little of the powder from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold when he saw this he joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think of nothing save the gold but whilst he was occupied with taking up the lumps of metal from the meltingpot the persian pulled out of his turband in haste a packet of cretan bhang which if an elephant smelt he would sleep from night to night and cutting off a little thereof put it in a piece of the sweetmeat then said he o hasan thou art become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth and i have a daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace now i see that thou befittest none but her and she none but thee wherefore if it be allahs will i will marry thee to her replied hasan i am thy servant and whatso good thou dost with me will be a deposit with the almighty and the persian rejoined o my son have fair patience and fair shall betide thee therewith he gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand put it in his mouth knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time for only the lord of futurity knoweth the future but hardly had he swallowed it when he fell down head foregoing heels and was lost to the world whereupon the persian seeing him in such calamitous case rejoiced exceedingly and cried thou hast fallen into my snares o gallowscarrion o dog of the arabs this many a year have i sought thee and now i have found thee o hasan—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightyfirst nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the ajami and fell fainting to the ground the persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried this many a year have i sought thee and now i have found thee then he girt himself and pinioned hasans arms and binding his feet to his hands laid him in a chest which he emptied to that end and locked it upon him moreover he cleared another chest and laying therein all hasans valuables together with the piece of the first goldlump and the second ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock then he ran to the market and fetching a porter took up the two chests and made off with them to a place within sight of the city where he set them down on the seashore hard by a vessel at anchor there now this craft had been freighted and fitted out by the persian and her master was awaiting him so when the crew saw him they came to him and bore the two chests on board then the persian called out to the rais or captain saying up and let us be off for i have done my desire and won my wish so the skipper sang out to the sailors saying weigh anchor and set sail and the ship put out to sea with a fair wind so far concerning the persian but as regards hasans mother she awaited him till suppertime but heard neither sound nor news of him so she went to the house and finding it thrown open entered and saw none therein and missed the two chests and their valuables wherefore she knew that her son was lost and that doom had overtaken him and she buffeted her face and rent her raiment crying out and wailing and saying alas my son ah alas the fruit of my vitals ah and she recited these coupletsmy patience fails me and grows anxiety  and with your absence       nbsp     growth of grief i seeby allah patience went what time ye went  loss of all hope how       nbsp     suffer patientlywhen lost my loved one how can joy i sleep  who shall enjoy       nbsp     such life of low degreethou rt gone and desolating house and home  hast fouled the       nbsp     fount erst flowed from foulness freethou wast my fame my grace mid folk my stay  mine aid wast       nbsp     thou in all adversityperish the day when from mine eyes they bore  my friend till       nbsp     sight i thy return to meand she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn when the neighbours came in to her and asked her of her son and she told them what had befallen him with the persian assured that she should never never see him again then she went round about the house weeping and wending she espied two lines written upon the wall so she sent for a scholar who read them to her and they were theseleylas phantom came by night when drowsiness had overcome me       nbsp     towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the       nbsp     desertbut when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom i saw the air       nbsp     vacant and the place of visitation was distantwhen hasans mother heard these lines she shrieked and said yes o my son indeed the house is desolate and the visitationplace is distant then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son went away but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write hasans name and the date of his loss and thenceforward she quitted it not but made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day such was her case but touching her son hasan and the ajami this persian was a magian who hated moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who fell into his power he was a lewd and filthy villain a hankerer after alchemy an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards such an one as he of whom quoth the poeta dog dogfathered by doggrandsire bred  no good in dog       nbsp     from dog race issuedeen for a gnat no restingplace gives he  who is composed of       nbsp     seed by all men shedthe name of this accursed was bahrám the guebre and he was wont every year to take a moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes so when he had carried out his plot against hasan the goldsmith they sailed on from dawn till dark when the ship made fast to the shore for the night and at sunrise when they set sail again bahram bade his black slaves and white servants bring him the chest wherein were hasan they did so and he opened it and taking out the young man made him sniff up vinegar and blew a powder into his nostrils hasan sneezed and vomited the bhang then opening his eyes he looked about him right and left and found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail and saw the persian sitting by him wherefore he knew that the accursed magian had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril against which his mother had warned him so he spake the saying which shall never shame the sayer to wit there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great verity we are allahs and unto him we are returning o my god be thou gracious to me in thine appointment and give me patience to endure this thine affliction o lord of the three worlds then he turned to the persian and bespoke him softly saying o my father what fashion is this and where is the covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to me but bahram stared at him and replied o dog knoweth the like of me bond of bread and salt i have slain of youths like thee a thousand save one and thou shalt make up the thousand and he cried out at him and hasan was silent knowing that the fateshaft had shot him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightysecond nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned persian he bespoke him softly but gained naught thereby for the ajami cried out at him in wrath so he was silent knowing that the fateshaft had shot him then the accursed bade loose his pinionbonds and they gave him a little water to drink whilst the magian laughed and said by the virtue of the fire and the light and the shade and the heat methought not thou wouldst fall into my nets but the fire empowered me over thee and helped me to lay hold upon thee that i might win my wish and return and make thee a sacrifice to her so she may accept of me quoth hasan thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt whereupon the magus raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and biting the deck with his foreteeth swooned away whilst the tears trickled down his cheeks then the guebre bade his servants light him a fire and hasan said what wilt thou do with it replied the magian this is the fire lady of light and sparkles bright this it is i worship and if thou wilt worship her even as i verily i will give thee half my monies and marry thee to my maiden daughter thereupon hasan cried angrily at him woe to thee thou art a miscreant magian who to fire dost pray in lieu of the king of omnipotent sway creator of night and day and this is naught but a calamity among creeds at this the magian was wroth and said to him wilt thou not then conform with me o dog of the arabs and enter my faith but hasan consented not to this so the accursed guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire bade his pages throw him flat on his face they did so and he beat him with a hide whip of plaited thongs till his flanks were laid open whilst he cried aloud for aid but none aided him and besought protection but none protected him then he raised his eyes to the allpowerful king and sought of him succour in the name of the chosen prophet and indeed patience failed him his tears ran down his cheeks like rain and he repeated these couplets twainin patience o my god thy doom forecast  ill bear an thereby       nbsp     come thy grace at lasttheyve dealt us wrong transgressed and ordered ill  haply thy       nbsp    grace shall pardon what is pastthen the magian bade his negroslaves raise him to a sitting posture and bring him somewhat of meat and drink so they sat food before him but he consented not to eat or drink and bahram ceased not to torment him day and night during the whole voyage whilst hasan took patience and humbled himself in supplication before almighty allah to whom belong honour and glory whereby the guebres heart was hardened against him they ceased not to sail the sea three months during which time hasan was continually tortured till allah almighty sent forth upon them a foul wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship by reason of the fierce gale whereupon quoth the captain and crew by allah this is all on account of yonder youth who hath been these three months in torture with this magian indeed this is not allowed of god the most high then they rose against the magian and slew his servants and all who were with him which when he saw he made sure of death and feared for himself so he loosed hasan from his bonds and pulling off the ragged clothes the youth had on clad him in others and made excuses to him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native land saying o my son return me not evil for that i have done with thee quoth hasan how can i ever rely upon thee again and quoth bahram o my son but for sin there were no pardon indeed i did all these doings with thee but to try thy patience and thou knowest that the case is altogether in the hands of allah so the crew and captain rejoiced in hasans release and he called down blessings on them and praised the almighty and thanked him with this the wind was stilled and the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage then said hasan to bahram o master whither wendest thou replied the magian o my son i am bound for the mountain of clouds where is the elixir which we use in alchemy and the guebre swore to him by the fire and the light that he had no longer any cause to fear him so hasans heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the persians words he continued to eat and drink and sleep with the magian who clad him in his own raiment they ceased not sailing on other three months when the ship came to anchor off a long shoreline of many coloured pebbles white and yellow and skyblue and black and every other hue and the magian sprang up and said o hasan come let us go ashore for we have reached the place of our wish and will so hasan rose and landed with bahram after the persian had commended his goods to the captains care they walked on inland till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight when bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettledrum of copper and a silken strap worked in gold with characts beat the drum with the strap until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste hasan marvelled at the magians doings and was afraid of him he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed but bahram looked at him and said what aileth thee o my son by the truth of the fire and the light thou hast naught to fear from me and were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means i had not brought thee ashore so rejoice in all good for yonder cloud of dust is the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereof—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightythird nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian said to hasan in very sooth yonder dustcloud is the cloud of something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and will make easy to us the hardships thereof presently the dust lifted off three shedromedaries one of which bahram mounted and hasan another then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven days till they came to a wide champaign and descending into its midst they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold so they alighted and entering thereunder ate and drank and took their rest anon hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something lofty said to the magian what is that o nuncle bahram replied tis a palace and quoth hasan wilt thou not go thither that we may enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting it but the persian was wroth and said name not to me yonder palace for therein dwelleth a foe with whom there befel me somewhat whereof this is no time to tell thee then he beat the kettledrum and up came the dromedaries and they mounted and fared on other seven days on the eighth day the magian said o hasan what seest thou hasan replied i see clouds and mists twixt east and west quoth bahram that is neither clouds nor mists but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the clouds split and there are no clouds above it for its exceeding height and surpassing elevation yon mount is my goal and thereon is the need we seek tis for that i brought thee hither for my wish may not be won save at thy hands hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost and said to the magian by the right of that thou worshippest and by the faith wherein thou believest i conjure thee to tell me what is the object wherefor thou hast brought me bahram replied the art of alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split such a site is yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and i purpose to send thee up thither to fetch it and when we have it i will show thee the secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn hasan answered in his fear tis well o my master and indeed he despaired of life and wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two coupletsconsider but thy lord his work shall bring  comfort to thee       nbsp   with quick relief and neardespair not when thou sufferest sorest bane  in bane how many       nbsp   blessed boons appearthey ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that mountain where they halted and hasan saw thereon a palace and asked bahram what be yonder palace whereto he answered tis the abode of the jann and ghuls and satans then the magian alighted and making hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him bear me no ill will anent that i did with thee for i will keep guard over thee in thine ascent to the palace and i conjure thee not to trick and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom and i and thou will share equally therein and hasan replied to hear is to obey then bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of wheat ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks then he took out the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap whereupon up came the dromedaries he chose out one and said hearken o my son o hasan to what i am about to enjoin on thee and hasan replied tis well bahram continued lie down on this skin and i will sew thee up therein and lay thee on the ground whereupon the rakham birds will come to thee and carry thee up to the mountaintop take this knife with thee and when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have set thee down slit open therewith the skin and come forth the vultures will then take fright at thee and fly away whereupon do thou look down from the mountain head and speak to me and i will tell thee what to do so he sewed him up in the skin placing therein three cakes and a leathern bottle full of water and withdrew to a distance presently a vulture pounced upon him and taking him up flew away with him to the mountaintop and there set him down as soon as hasan felt himself on the ground he slit the skin and coming forth called out to the magian who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy saying to him look behind thee and tell me what thou seest hasan looked and seeing many rotten bones and much wood told bahram who said to him this be what we need and seek make six bundles of the wood and throw them down to me for this is wherewithal we do alchemy so he threw him the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to hasan o gallows bird i have won my wish of thee and now if thou wilt thou mayst abide on this mountain or cast thyself down to the earth and perish so saying he left him and went away and hasan exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this hound hath played the traitor with me and he sat bemoaning himself and reciting these coupletswhen god upon a man possessed of reasoning hearing and sight       nbsp   his will in aught to pass would bringhe stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit from       nbsp    him as one draws out the hairs to paste that clingtill his decrees fulfilled he gives him back his wit that       nbsp   therewithal he may receive admonishingso say thou not of aught that haps how happened it for fate       nbsp    and fortune fixed do order everything—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightyfourth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the magian sent hasan to the mountaintop and made him throw down all he required he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this damned hound hath played the traitor then he rose to his feet and looked right and left after which he walked on along the mountain top in mind making certain of death he fared on thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain along which he saw a darkblue sea dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves each as it were a lofty mount so he sat down and repeated what he might of the koran and besought allah the most high to ease him of his troubles or by death or by deliverance from such strait then he recited for himself the funeralprayer and cast himself down into the main but the waves bore him up by allahs grace so that he reached the water unhurt and the angel in whose charge is the sea watched over him so that the billows bore him safe to land by the decree of the most high thereupon he rejoiced and praised almighty allah and thanked him after which he walked on in quest of something to eat for stress of hunger and came presently to the place where he had halted with the magian bahram then he fared on awhile till behold he caught sight of a great palace rising high in air and knew it for that of which he had

Rum Whisky,Akshay Verma,2012,ira glasspreviously on serial     aisha pittman     he kinda just always generally annoyed me because just the constant paging her if she was out     adnan syed     each time that she ended the relationship or took a break it was never a thing where i was like pestering her or like going to her house and knocking on the door     jay     he said to me that he was going to uh tell her his car was broken down and uh ask her for a rideautomated voicethis is a globaltel link prepaid call from adnan syed an inmate at a maryland correctional facility…sarah koenigfrom this american life and wbez chicago it’s serial one story week by week i’m sarah koenigthe cops that investigated the murder of hae min lee were both experienced baltimore city detectives their names were ritz and macgillivary bill ritz and greg macgillivary and how i wish right now that i could play you tape of their perspective on this case but they didn’t want to be interviewed when bill ritz finally turned me down after six weeks of back and forth he said he didn’t see the point the case has been adjudicated what good would it do i also spoke on the phone briefly to macgillivary and he said just a few sentences to me and one of them was “beyond question he did it” meaning adnan did it he didn’t hem or haw or hesitate he remembered the case right away “beyond question he did it” how did they arrive at that level of certaintybefore hae’s body was found this was a missing person case she disappeared january 13 and the investigation starts out a little slowly which makes sense to me she’s a not a small child she’s eighteen she’s got a car which is also missing that first day the police call around to her friends they talk to aisha to adnan remember that’s when he tells them he was supposed to get a ride from her but didn’t the next day they call around to hospitals hotels motels they check the area around the high school parking lot where she was last seen you can see from their reports that they immediately hone in on the most time warn explanation for such disappearances the boyfriends current and former that first day they call don her new guy they check the area around his house which is in another county northeast of baltimore over the next two weeks they keep going back to don and to adnan asking more questionsthey check don’s alibi he was indeed at lenscrafters store the day hae went missing the manager tells them and they talk to adnan’s track coach to check adnan’s alibi and it’s inconclusive the coach tells them he can’t be sure adnan practiced that day they don’t take attendance on february 6 they do that awful foreboding thing you see on tv sometimes they take a team of dogs to check the wooded areas and fields around woodlawn high school they used hae’s curling iron for a scent on february 8 they make a report saying they’re going to check hae’s computer her aol account for clues and then on february 9 their search stops and a new suspect emerges     detective     testing one two three testing one two threesarah koenigthis is tape from a police interview of the man who finds hae he’s a little hard to hear on the tape he’s softspoken i’m going to call this man mr s i don’t want to use his real name for reasons that i promise will become clear mr s works in the maintenance department at a local school     mr s     i think i may have discovered a body in leakin parksarah koenig“i think i may have discovered a body in leakin park” he says before i get to the slightly offkilter story about how mr s discovered this body just a word here about leakin park it’s actually spelled leakin park leakin but almost everyone in baltimore pronounces it linkin’ park it’s huge over 1000 acres on the western edge of baltimore city it’s got a reputation and not for the beauty of its woods or its trails or its nature center what it’s known for sadly is its dead bodies mention leakin park to people from baltimore as i often did and you’re pretty much guaranteed to get a comment like this     unidentified man     while you’re digging in leakin park to bury your body you’re gonna find somebody else’s that’s leakin parksarah koenigwhen i told a rental car guy in west baltimore i was working on a story about a girl who was found in leakin park he said “oh yeah my uncle was found dead in leakin park” a macabre website dedicated to baltimore murders lists sixtyeight bodies found there since 1946 though the list is missing at least seven years of stats and that number is probably low a lot of lawabiding baltimoreans they don’t really know where leakin park is rabia chaudry that family friend of adnan’s who first contacted me about this case when she’s explaining it to me she said “yeah and is adnan supposed to get to leakin park so fast it’s like an hour into the city”     rabia chaudry     leakin park is nowhere near the schoolsarah koenigher brother saad adnan’s best friend he didn’t know anything about leakin park either     saad chaudry     after adnan had initially got arrested when i was on the phone with him talking when he was locked up i was like “leakin park where is that do you even know where that is have you ever been there” and he was like “i have never been there i don’t even know where it is” so living around here we don’t know but it’s somewhere in the inner citysarah koenigwhere hae was found is in fact less than three miles from where saad and rabia are sitting right now in an office across the street from woodlawn high school about a seven minute drive they had no idea     saad chaudry     we wouldn’t go there we’d go to the harbor or somewhere nice but there’s no reason for us to go theresarah koenigi’m explaining all this just to say that the simple fact that hae was found in leakin park for a lot of people that alone made adnan look innocent “what’s a nice boy like you doing in a park like this”     mr s     and i walked around through the bushes and everythingsarah koenigso now mr s he also told the cops he had never been to that part of leakin park before though he did seem to know that people go fishing back there here’s what he told the copsat his job he had gotten a work order to shave down a door but the school didn’t have the tool he needed a plane he had one at home though so during his lunch hour he said he drove his truck home got the plane from his basement and before he left grabbed some sustenance out of the fridge     mr s     i grabbed a beer out of my refrigerator it was a 22ounce budweiser i was drinking it on my way back to the school where i work at and had to go to the bathroom so i pulled over and i went further into the woods so nobody would see me urinate and when i discovered what looked like a bodysarah koenigso was drinking this 22ounce budweiser and he’s heading back to work and his route to the college is through leakin park and suddenly he has to pee badly he says he stops on franklin town road he’s about three miles from work there’s a small pull off and some concrete barriers and he walks back in there quite a ways it seems like for a guy who just has to pee later they’d measure 127 feet back into the woods is where he goes this next tape is a little upsetting     mr s     and i got back that way and i was getting ready to urinate and i looked down and seen something that looked like hair and something is covered under the dirt and it looked no good again and until i seen something that looked like a foot     detective     what drew your attention to the area that you went to there was something there     mr s     it was an open area     detective     an open area     mr s     mmhmm     detective     but there was also a fallen tree is that correct     mr s     yes there was     detective     did you go to that area for a certain reason     mr s     no no     detective     no     mr s     nosarah koenigthey are suspicious of mr s who by this time has become a suspect in the case this tape was made on february 18 nine days after mr s reported finding the body they’re going over the details carefully because there are parts of his story that are a little weird one of them is this thing about the fallen tree 127 feet back into the woods there was a fallen tree essentially a forty foot log lying more or less parallel to the road on the other side of the log if you kept going you’d have gotten to a stream with the unfortunate name of dean run hae’s body was buried right behind this log on the stream side if you were standing  on the street side of the log so on the other side it’s not at all obvious that you’d notice her so this story about why he stopped where he stopped it doesn’t quite seem right here’s bill ritz     detective bill ritz     when you’re walking back to this area where you finally stop why did you pick that particular area     mr s     unintelligible pick that area i was going to go back further except for that’s when i’d seen the hair and the foot i left after that     detective bill ritz     so you were actually going to go back further     mr s     yessarah koenigin this part of the tape you get a sense of how ritz and macgillivary operate together or at least what i gather from listening to a bunch of these interviews macgillivary starts all nonjudgemental “just tell me your story uh huh uh huh” then ritz comes in and says something like “just help me understand  here” and asks some harder question exposing weaknesses in the narrative then macgillivary will come back in but now it’s a tougher macgillivary and he’s asking direct sometimes harsh questions that seem like they’d be good at pushing someone off balance like this one sort of out of the blue     detective greg macgillivary     have you ever been inside that girl’s car before     mr s     no     detective greg macgillivary     no okaysarah koenig     back to the fallen tree here ritz is saying “wait i thought you told macgillivary you stopped at the log to pee but now you’re saying that you were on your way farther back”     detective bill ritz     stop there you said before you were getting ready to urinate and that’s when you looked down and discovered the hair now you’re saying you actually going to go back further     mr s     before i discovered her     detective bill ritz     before you discovered her     mr s     mmhmm     detective bill ritz     maybe i’m a little bit confused as you’re standing on the south side of the tree between the tree and the roadsarah koenigthis doesn’t ever get cleared up really and they sort of let it go but a bunch of things are fishy the path he takes in the woods it doesn’t really lead to the log so why does he end up there he didn’t need to head toward the log to find a spot to pee there so many other choices and if you’re walking through brush and brambles wouldn’t you sort of naturally avoid a big log  you would need to step over what they are trying to get at is did you really just stumble on this body or were you looking for this body because you already knew where it was that is a reasonable question because hae’s body wasn’t just hard to spot it was nearly impossible to spotalright we’re in the state’s attorney’s office we just got delivered the first box of what they’re saying is discloseable under whatever public information act that i didi didn’t understand how camouflaged the body was until i saw photos of the crime scene the way mr s found it before they removed the body i was in the state’s attorney’s office in baltimore i went there with a crime reporter from the baltimore sun his name is justin george i had been talking to justin about this story and he was interested in maybe writing about it too we opened a packet of photos together some of them were awful to see as you’d imagine there was one where you could make out a bit of black hair amid dirt and leaves     sarah koenig     how did he notice that     justin george     how could he notice the body i don’t understand that either i mean it’s pretty well covered     sarah koenig     yeah there’s barely anything showing wait are we supposed to be looking at something there what is that is that her that all he saw     justin george     that looks to be part of the body yeah i expected it to be more visible than it issarah koenigjustin and i weren’t the only ones who had this reaction the city surveyor a guy named philip buddemayer went out to the burial site to measure the distance from the road this is before they disintered her here’s buddemayer testifying at trial     philip buddemeyer     when i arrived at the site where the body was there was a log on the ground approximately forty feet long i stepped over the log i walked along the edge of the log expecting to find the body real soon i never saw one at which time had i taken one more step i would have walked on the gravesite where the body was     female court official     and at that point there were others on the scene     philip buddemeyer     yes ma’am there was a lot of people there     female court official     and at some point did someone point out to you the exact location     philip buddemeyer     yes ma’am the detective pointed out the site i looked down at the ground and i said “i don’t see any body” it wasn’t freshly disturbed     female court official     it was not freshly disturbed     philip buddemeyer     no yeah it just blended in with the natural surroundings of the groundsarah koenigso here’s a guy who’s looking for the body who knows where it’s supposed to be who can see there’s a bunch of people standing around it and still he can’t find it so does it seem reasonable that mr s who apparently  wasn’t looking for anything besides as secluded place to pee discovered it just like thatthe other thing that’s a little odd is this business of having to pee the spot where mr s stops is only a few miles from his house and only a few more miles from his work yet he can’t wait here’s detective ritz questioning mr s again     detective bill ritz     while you were at home did you have to use the bathroom at all     mr s     no i didn’t feel i had to go at the time     detective bill ritz     so within seven or eight minutes how much of the 22ounce beer had you consumed     mr s     i think it was almost     detective bill ritz     it was almost empty     mr s     mmhmm     detective bill ritz     and that seven or eight minute period you had to go to the bathroom it was cough an urgent need would you need     mr s     yes it wassarah koenigyet mr s says he never did pee in the woods says he ended up waiting until he gets to work which okay maybe that makes sense he’d had a shock but why would he walk so far in in the first place he was just trying to have a quick pee and why was he studying the ground ritz asks him about this     detective bill ritz     you got out of your vehicle ventured back into the woods when we measured it it was 127 feet off the roadway as you’re walking along why are you looking down at the ground are you looking every step that you take or     mr s     so i didn’t stumble     detective bill ritz     so you wouldn’t stumble     mr s     mmhmm     sarah koenig     are you counting     justin george     uhhuh ten eleven twelvesarah koenigon a freezing day back in february of this year we went out to leakin park we wanted to know whether  it was strange that he’d gone so far back into the woods like what did 127 feet from the road look like my producer dana was with me and so was justin george from the baltimore sun right at the place where  mr s had entered the woods right at the road justin noticed a sign     sarah koenig     what’s that     justin george     look at it i mean the sign says a lotsarah koenigit say’s “this area patrolled dumpers will be prosecuted” you could barely read it it’s hard to read a sign that’s covered in grafitti and pierced with seven bullet holes in fact the cops found twenty cartrige casings in right about this spot when they collected evidence in 1999 still i felt the park itself was quite lovely brambles and trees it’s rocky near the stream it’s uneven terrain not hilly but it’s not flat either     sarah koenig     it’s not nearly as creepy as imagined it     justin george     i think it is at night     sarah koenig     at night     justin george     yeah i think at dusk i think it is very bleak twentyone twentytwo twentythreesarah koenigwe walked in what we thought was about 127 feet justin paced it out by the yard     justin george     fortytwo it would be right about theresarah koenigwe actually wander around for a while trying to find the right spot finally i remember we have a hand drawn map of the site from that surveyor buddemeyer who testified forty foot long fifteen inch log on the groundonce we get to the right location it dawns on all of us 127 feet back doesn’t feel all that far if you’re looking for privacy you can still see the cars on the road from where we’re standing     sarah koenig     so if he’s peeing at least you’d want to come this far     dana chivvis     there’s not a lot of foliage     sarah koenig     there’s nothing there’s some dead leaves or whatever you can totally see the cars so actually that doesn’t seem that weird to mesarah koenigsuddenly mr s’s story seems eminently more believable while we’re in the woods i fill justin in on the evidence they collected hereright near the body was a liquor bottle from which they got cellular material and never tested and a rope that was never tested as far as i know and then up at the road they found a condom and a condom wrapper but i think the condom was still rolled i don’t think it was a used condom necessarily and they found a bunch of shell casings they found bullets and shell casings and stuff from two different guns and they found two blockbuster video cases but by the body was the i think the only thing they got right from the area of the body was the liquor bottle and the ropei know it sounds like a game of clue except for the condom part as for the liquor bottle back at the taped interview with mr s detectives ritz and macgillivary want to find out if this guy could be the source of that liquor bottle “did you drink anything besides beer” they ask “yeah” he says “what” “whiskey” “what kind” “windsor canadian whiskey” “what denomination” “maybe half a pint”     detective greg macgillivary     did you ever take a bottle into the car with you also a half pint did you ever take that in the car keep you warm     mr s     sometimes     detective greg macgillivary     keep you warm     mr s     mmm     detective greg macgillivary     take a nip here and there yes     mr s     yes     detective greg macgillivary     okaysarah koenignow ritz comes in “we’ve collected evidence” he says “cans and bottles from the crime scene we’re going to test them” he’s bluffing here they never do test “are we gonna find your dna on one of those bottles” he asks “maybe you threw a bottle out the window when you were driving past coming home from work if so you’d better tell us now”     detective bill ritz     and it’s important we know that because what we’re going to do is analyze that and come back six months or a month or three weeks from now and say “we have evidence that you were deceptive with us we have dna evidence that you were there” and then you say     detective ritz i forgot because i’d gone fishing out there that weekend i told you people go fishing out there i told you i drank half a pint and i threw a bottle unintelligible so take a minute and think if there are any of the items that i described whiskey bottles beer bottles soda cans or anything like that where you may have discarded in that general area     mr s     i’m not sure i could have but i’m not positive cuz i know i throw a lot of bottles out the windowsarah koenighe says “i’m not sure i could have but i’m not positive cuz i know i throw a lot of bottles out the window” ah ritz asks “what bottles” “beer bottles” “whiskey maybe” “it’s possible” he says “anything else” well for a while he switched to rum “what rum” “dark rum bacardi” finally macgillivary can’t stand it he just starts listing different kinds of booze     detective greg macgillivary     no jack     mr s     not probably a long time ago     detective greg macgillivary     vodka     mr s     years ago     detective greg macgillivary     brandy     mr s     no no brandy     detective greg macgillivary     cognac     mr s     no     detective greg macgillivary     just cheap stuff     mr s     yeahsarah koenig“just cheap stuff” “yeah” brandy brandy was the answer they were looking for the bottle they found near hae’s body was coronet vsq brandy 200ml and mr s he blew right past itconsider for a moment if mr s was just trying to relieve his bladder in peace that february day minding his own business and then he sees this terrible sad sight and he does the right thingtells the cops shows them where she’s buried well how horrible now that they’re so suspicious of him that they’re considering that maybe either he did it or he knows who did how terrifying for mr s after all he seems like a nice quiet guy cooperative doesn’t appear to be a brandy drinker again i can only go by the reports and files but my guess is the reason the cops are holding on to mr s as a suspect is because mr s has a little bit of a record which isn’t necessarily a big deal but and here’s the part of the story where you’ll understand why i’m not using name mr s is a streaker and not the frat party kind the freaky kindhe’s got indecent exposure charges to borrow a phrase from adnan’s defense attorney under circumstances that ‘bizarre’ doesn’t even begin to define mr s is arrested may of ‘94 for running about naked in residential neighborhood two years later march of ‘96 he’s spotted wearing a hoodie sunglasses white sneakers and nothing else the officer writes “the southwestern district has received numerous calls for service in the past three years to this area for the same incident same description” past three years the officer chases down mr s onto i95 mr s jumps some chain link fences the kind with razor wire at the top ends up in the hospital it gets worse or better depending whether you enjoy police reports as much as i do december 7 1998 so barely two months before mr s finds hae’s body there’s this at around noon during what i have to imagine is what mr s’s lunch break a lady named margaret is driving along and here’s the report “black male dashed out in front of my car and began shaking his body in a up and down motion the male had on no clothes his penis was exposed as he faced my vehicle shaking” and this lady margaret is a police officer in uniform she chases him but he runs down into the metro stop margaret finds his work clothes in a pile and takes them which means unless mr s has a second outfit stashed someplace he’s riding back to work in the altogetherthen there’s another twist to this incident the same day he flashes margaret so december 7 1998 mr s files his own police report “there’s been a theft” he says from his car someone has taken his cell phone his money his keys his work clothes but you and i we know who has all of it officer margaretstreaking isn’t a violent crime or necessarily a sexual one and there’s no evidence that hae was sexually assaulted anyway but you could imagine both sets of eyebrows rising on ritz and macgillivary’s faces when they see these reports it’s strange behavior they never ask mr s about it on tape but i figure he knew they knew and they knew he knew they knew the same day they interview him on tape february 18 they also give him a polygraph test which he fails deception indicated was the conclusion but the testor also said mr s seemed to be nervous cuz apparently he had an important meeting with a realtor that day his wife was expecting him to pick her up so the tester recommends a do over about a week later they give him another polygraph this time with different questions for instance “do you know if that girl you found died because she was hit with a tire iron” i guess that’s a thing this time the result is no deception indicated he passes and very quickly mr s fades from their viewhere’s what my own thoughts were when i learned about mr s i didn’t really think “oh maybe he did it maybe he killed hae” but i did wonder if maybe he’d heard something about the crime and about where she was buried because it did seem a tad unbelievable to me that he spotted her the way he said he did one theory i had was maybe one of his step kids or a neighbor had told him about the body because maybe they had heard about it through other kids at school then maybe mr s just as a good samaritan thought “someone needs to go find this girl tell the cops” but he doesn’t want to say he’s heard about it beforehand because he doesn’t want to get anyone else in trouble mr s didn’t want to talk to me after i made several requests he asked if i would please leave him alone fair enoughi tried every which way to figure out if he knew or anyone in his family knew adnan or jay or any of the people jay had told about the murder and vice versa whether any of them had ever heard of mr s i found no connections the closest i got was bear with me i found out that mr s’s sisterinlaw was a math teacher at woodlawn back in 1999 when all this happened so i called her hae was her student she said an excellent student top of the line but she didn’t think mr s knew anything about the crime before he found the body she put her husband on the phone mr s’s younger halfbrother and he said “you know what’s crazy i used to live next door to the kid that did it” that was back when adnan was nine or ten he said he used to throw the football around with him that he always seemed like a nice kid but again he said he thought his brother stumbled on the body by accident the he paused chuckled and said “i think he was running through the woods streaking and that’s how he found it” when i told him that apparently he had stopped to take a pee he said “that’s possible too”so maybe mr s is telling the truth after all why would a guy who’s been in trouble repeatedly for indecent exposure seek out a dead girl thus inevitably inviting more police contact to rain down upon himmr s wasn’t the detectives only lead in this case we know there were also

et n’y pas trop compterfaire ce qu’on a fait être ce que nous sommeset regarder le ciel sans m’en inquiéterje ne puis  — malgré moi l’infini me tourmenteje n’y saurais songer sans crainte et sans espoir et quoi qu’on en ait dit ma raison s’épouvantede ne pas le comprendre et pourtant de le voirqu’estce donc que ce monde et qu’y venonsnous fairesi pour qu’on vive en paix il faut voiler les cieux passer comme un troupeau les yeux fixés à terreet renier le reste estce donc être heureux non c’est cesser d’être homme et dégrader son âmedans la création le hasard m’a jeté heureux ou malheureux je suis né d’une femmeet je ne puis m’enfuir hors de l’humanitéque faire donc   jouis dit la raison païenne jouis et meurs  les dieux ne songent qu’à dormir— espère seulement répond la foi chrétienne le ciel veille sans cesse et tu ne peux mourirentre ces deux chemins j’hésite et je m’arrêteje voudrais à l’écart suivre un plus doux sentieril n’en existe pas dit une voix secrète en présence du ciel il faut croire ou nierje le pense en effet  les âmes tourmentéesdans l’un et l’autre excès se jettent tour à tourmais les indifférents ne sont que des athées ils ne dormiraient plus s’ils doutaient un seul jourje me résigne donc et puisque la matièreme laisse dans le cœur un désir plein d’effroimes genoux fléchiront  je veux croire et j’espèreque vaisje devenir et que veuton de moi me voilà dans les mains d’un dieu plus redoutableque ne sont à la fois tous les maux d’icibas me voilà seul errant fragile et misérablesous les yeux d’un témoin qui ne me quitte pasil m’observe il me suit si mon cœur bat trop vitej’offense sa grandeur et sa divinitéun gouffre est sous mes pas  si je m’y précipitepour expier une heure il faut l’éternitémon juge est un bourreau qui trompe sa victimepour moi tout devient piège et tout change de noml’amour est un péché le bonheur est un crimeet l’œuvre des sept jours n’est que tentationje ne garde plus rien de la nature humaine il n’existe pour moi ni vertu ni remordj’attends la récompense et j’évite la peine mon seul guide est la peur et mon seul but la morton me dit cependant qu’une joie infinieattend quelques élus où sontils ces heureux si vous m’avez trompé me rendrezvous la vie si vous m’avez dit vrai m’ouvrirezvous les cieux hélas  ce beau pays dont parlaient vos prophètess’il existe làhaut ce doit être un désertvous les voulez trop purs les heureux que vous faiteset quand leur joie arrive ils en ont trop souffertje suis seulement homme et ne veux pas moins êtreni tenter davantage — a quoi donc m’arrêter puisque je ne puis croire aux promesses du prêtreestce l’indifférent que je vais consulter si mon cœur fatigué du rêve qui l’obsèdea la réalité revient pour s’assouvirau fond des vains plaisirs que j’appelle à mon aideje trouve un tel dégoût que je me sens mouriraux jours même où parfois la pensée est impieoù l’on voudrait nier pour cesser de douterquand je posséderais tout ce qu’en cette viedans ses vastes désirs l’homme peut convoiter donnezmoi le pouvoir la santé la richessel’amour même l’amour le seul bien d’icibas que la blonde astarté qu’idolâtrait la grècede ses îles d’azur sorte en m’ouvrant les bras quand je pourrais saisir dans le sein de la terreles secrets élémens de sa féconditétransformer à mon gré la vivace matièreet créer pour moi seul une unique beauté quand horace lucrèce et le vieil épicureassis à mes côtés m’appelleraient heureuxet quand ces grands amans de l’antique natureme chanteraient la joie et le mépris des dieux je leur dirais à tous  — quoi que nous puissions faireje souffre il est trop tard  le monde s’est fait vieuxune immense espérance a traversé la terre malgré nous vers le ciel il faut lever les yeux que me restetil donc  ma raison révoltéeessaie en

Zaroori Tha,Rahat Fateh Ali Khan,2014,how many words would have been clinging to your feet when finally my burning sensation will end when the flowers will be taken out from the books you must have remembered the one who gave it it was also necessary to answer the river of your eyes love was also necessary discipline was also necessary it was necessary that both of us would apologize but still it was also necessary to express our feelings it was also necessary to answer the river of your eyes tell me do you remember when your heart was stolen you made the stolen things a house of god wow when you used to say you recite my name in rosary you are afraid to complete the prayers of love but now i remember those were just things in some things only it was also necessary to deny it was also necessary to descend from the river of your eyes thats right you are my dear i am there you are there but i am lost but you are also lost somewhere i was burnt in love so we were infidels so we are infidels we got our destination but still we were travelers we are travelers where did we take you out of your heart where did i reach after getting lost but after getting lost i remembered that getting lost was also necessary love was also necessary separation was also necessary it was necessary that both of us would apologize for our feelings but then it was also necessary to shed the feelings it was also necessary to bring down the tears from your eyes

Radio (Film Version),"Pritam, Kamaal Khan, Amit Mishra",2017,neffa nel corso della sua ormai trentennale carriera ha sempre dimostrato un talento incredibile nel capire le infinite diramazioni del ritmo e della musica qualità questa che gli ha permesso di muoversi trasversalmente per generi e stili differenti senza mai risultare inopportuno o fuori contesto franco battiato che neffa ha avuto la possibilità di intervistare nel ’98 per mtv scrisse per quello che sarà per molto tempo l’album più venduto in italia un pezzo dal titolo “segnali di vita” e i prime versi sembrano essere perfetti per la carriera che il “chico” nato a scafati ma cresciuto a bologna ha vissuto in prima persona “il tempo cambia molte cose nella vita  il senso le amicizie le opinioni  che voglia di cambiare che cè in me  si sente il bisogno di una propria evoluzione  sganciata dalle regole comuni” dallhip hop al funk dal jazz allo swing dal hardcore metal alla musica napoletana in lui la voglia di cambiare ed evolversi è tratto distintivo e artistico per levergreen odierno cercheremo di rintracciare limmagine di un neffa in ascesa nellolimpo dellhip hop nostrano quando si vedeva in lui e nella sua “ballotta” l’immagine del messaggero in terra vergine del generese cè una cosa che non sorprende più un assiduo frequentatore di youtube la piattaforma di condivisione video più famosa al mondo è la magnificenza dellalgoritmo che sta alla base dei suggerimenti del video che si sta guardando sembra che ultimamente lo si può evincere dalla giovane vita dei commenti sotto al video questo tool abbia deciso di portare alla ribalta un cortometraggio italiano del 1997 semisconosciuto dal nome di “fame chimica” il regista paolo vari di questo piccolo racconto urbano collocato nel quartiere milanese giambellino ne fece poi un film omonimo forse più conosciuto ma che nella trasposizione perde il tratto caratteristico del cortometraggio ovvero lo slang veritiero che sembra essersi cristallizzato nella cultura giovanile della città e l’immagine dei bboy di quei tempi il termine “bboy” viene coniato nel 1969 da uno se non il vero fondatore dell’hiphop dj kool herc che durante i suoi set era solito a chiamare a raccolta i ballerini di breakdance con la frase bboys go down” in quegli stessi anni james brown artista nominato molte volte nelle sue liriche e decisamente amato da neffa infiammava il pubblico con le sue performance votate al movimento irresistibile e inevitabile scaturito dal ritmo funksoul nel passare degli anni il termine assunse via via il carattere associativo e più generale di “amante dellhip hop”ritornando al corto “fame chimica” questo narra le vicende di una notte brava del protagonista manuel zanuso “zarro” tamarro milanese e pusher di quartiere che cerca di muoversi nella realtà eterogenea della cultura hip hop milanese negli ultimi anni del ‘900 manuel è sì un pusher ma è anche un giovane ragazzo non ancora maggiorenne che vuole divertirsi e stringere amicizie con i suoi clienti il suo sporco lavoro gli darà quindi la possibilità di addentrarsi in diverse situazioni che un bboy di quei tempi esperiva dalle feste antiproibizioniste nei centri sociali al writing notturno nelle stazioni ferroviarie abbandonate al controllo di un solo sorvegliante ed è proprio durante questultima scena che la colonna sonora del cortometraggio ci regala una perla dellalbum di recente uscita “neffa e i messaggeri della dopa” ovvero “i fieri bboyz”esce il 14 maggio del 1996 edito da black out e mercury records ed è il primo album solista di neffa dopo le esperienze con isola posse all stars e sangue misto in esso però troviamo tutti i suoi compagni di viaggio e di musica che lo hanno accompagnato dal 1992 al 1995 i “messaggeri della dopa” appunto phase ii kaos dre love dj lugi esa storyteller dj gruff fuckin camelz n effect poi diventati camelz finnezza click topcat fede leftside ppt ossia chef ragoo e cenzou dirà nel documentario “numero zero – alle origini del rap italiano” “quando ebbi questo contratto il primo pensiero fu “voglio che tutti questi ragazzi abbiano la possibilità di andare in uno studio più carino fare le cose per bene prendere qualche soldo tutto quanto” e quindi per me era impensabile fare un disco solista da solo ci fu il lavoro di deda e poi tutte le persone che avevo conosciuto in quegli anni girando per tutte le realtà italiane ho cercato di rappresentarli il più possibile” tutti i pezzi del disco sono prodotti dallo stesso neffa tranne due prodotti dal socio deda “la ballotta” ed il celebre singolo “aspettando il sole” che vede la partecipazione del cantante dei casino royale giuliano palma questo singolo farà impattare luniverso hip hop nelle radio e quindi alle orecchie impreparate degli ascoltatori italiani che rimangono folgorati dalla base e il suono sostenuto ma scarno e dal testo nostalgico ma speranzoso neffa decide di battersi come faranno per almeno ventanni molti altri rapper e producer per innalzare lo status dellhip hop allora considerato divertissement per gli adolescenti a vero e proprio genere e arte musicale intrecciata alla radice black da cui è scaturito quindi al funk e al soul proprio per questa sua missione decide di ispirarsi ad art blakey and the jazz messengers un peso massimo del jazz americano e internazionale l’alchimia e la matematica musicale dicono che laddizione di jazz soul e funk darà sempre come risultato hip hop e così è statoaddentriamoci ora nella canzone dellevergreen “i fieri bboyz” vero e proprio inno di tutti i bboy e bgirl di tutta la penisola che vede la partecipazione di un liricista fenomenale kaos one“bbboys and bbgirls”la canzone inizia con un sample che fungerà da hook per tutto il pezzo di “breakers revenge 93” di zebrocski  stieber twins che chiama appunto a raccolta tutti gli amanti dellhip hop“lo vedi dallo sguardo strano che ho sul visolespressione che promette niente in dolcesenza sorriso a prima vista quietoma è un errore di giudizio quantomeno grossolanonon metterti mai contro un bboy fierocome fumo azzurro ti volteggia intornocerchi di colpirlo ma un bboy fiero quando è serio è troppo sveltosul marmo vola e non lo puoi fermare non lo puoi vedere”in questa prima parte della strofa kaos sta parlando delle caratteristiche del bboy per poi dopo nel riferimento al marmo concentrarsi sulla figura del breakdancer un bboy anche quando non balla segue lo stile di vita del movimento hip hop e quando si trova di fronte a una sfida egli diventa un guerriero e la componente aggressiva vale tanto quanto quella artisticoespressiva“veloce come la mano sul vinile sullacciaiosul muro lascia traccia di colore come un codice il concetto che ti estraneo rende tutto più difficileil disegno è complicato come un puzzle da tremila pezzise vuoi capire tocca che li incastri tutti”se nella prima parte della strofa kaos ha parlato di una sola delle quattro arti delluniverso hip hop subito dopo cita lo scratching larte del turntablism e il graffitismo è unarte ai più sconosciuta ma che in questo status di semiclandestinità unisce le persone che la vivonocome un crumiro sono un bboy fierobecause i represent just from my gente e un forte scrausorecluso come silvio pellico le mie prigioni sono un incubomentale tocca di uscire e come sai“le mie prigioni” è un libro di memorie scritto da silvio pellico e pubblicato nel 1832mentre pellico però fu veramente incarcerato dagli austriaci le prigioni per kaos hanno più un valore metafisico e sono appunto viste come incubi dai cui è obbligatorio a uscirela fotta di un bboy non si esaurisce maise vuoi restare resta se no bye byequi non cè la festasolo gente che ti spacca il culo con la dopa prendi notala strada per il funk per te è in salitastudia niente scorciatoie o giochi di prestigiocè solo hiphop che si trasmette per contagioquesto in casa tua nel tuo video nel tuo stereoprendilo per vero come un bboy fieroanche qui come più avanti nella canzone vengono portati alla luce elementi interessanti per capire come vivevano quella cultura in quei giorni ad esempio il fatto che per riuscire in quel contesto non ci fossero scorciatoie in quanto l’hip hop era incollato all’asfalto da cui era nato e distante dal primato nel mainstream dei giorni nostri un altro elemento interessante è la dimensione dello “studio” ma la vedremo più avantila dopa che smazzo di fisso ti spaccala rima che io caccio stona come thmetto fuoco alla ballotta quando faccio superché è il chico con la fotta che non smette piùeh yo ogni momento è buono e mo cercamiun paio di minuti e potrei anche non esserci chicaah via lascia che siamusica che avvolge lenergia questo suono in azionesopra il beat sangue di un guaglionequi chi cè snefs con la nuova trasmissionela strofa di neffa inizia con lo slang e con le figure ricorrenti all’inizio della sua discografia la dopa il thc la ballotta il chico la fotta il guaglione interessante notare l’associazione della doppia coppia “musica  energia” e “suono  azione” non è così ricorrente ai giorni d’oggi sentire una canzone così votata all’esperienza condivisa di un suono che causa fermento e movimento per le stradebboy fiero un totsono messaggero della dopa e rappresento la cultura hip hopquel che cè quel che avrai quel che avrai già saii breakers i writers le jam di freestylein quello che è una sorta di manifesto dellalbum neffa in questa strofa narra e racconta quello che era la cultura hiphop negli anni ’90dimentica gli spot e non è la rai  ambrasai che se fa il rap alli guaidistanti dalla recente rivalutazione delloperato artistico di ambra angiolini da parte di marracash in “persona” qui il “chico” si tiene bene a distanza da quello che allora era uno

compitoquando faccio faccio subito rapido nitidodipingo frasi un tot vivideimparo allarte sparo allarteun chico come me crede al funk dopo la mortequesto è per ied ecco ritornare la dimensione dello “studio” neffa utilizza verosimilmente termini scolastici per parlare dell’arte che ama che però a differenza delle materie insegnate negli istituti superiori è aderente alla realtà della strada che ha le sue regole e una sua didattica si deve essere in grado di stare in strada perché lì a differenza di quello dei mass media non ci sono scorciatoie e i limiti tra ciò che è legittimo e ciò che non

Khulne Do,Arijit Singh,2020,there was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before a merchant who dwelt in the land of bassorah and who owned two sons and wealth galore but in due time allah the allhearing the allknowing decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the most high so he died and his two sons laid him out and buried him after which they divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion each one opened a shop presently the elder son hasan hight a youth of passing beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace betook himself to the company of lewd folk women and low boys frolicking with them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done for that he exulted in the abundance of his good after some time he had wasted all his ready money so he sold all his fathers lands and houses and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing neither little nor muchel nor was one of his comrades left who knew him he abode thus anhungred he and his widowed mother three days and on the fourth day as he walked along unknowing whither to wend there met him a man of his fathers friends who questioned him of his case he told him what had befallen him and the other said o my son i have a brother who is a goldsmith an thou wilt thou shalt be with him and learn his craft and become skilled therein hasan consented and accompanied him to his brother to whom he commended him saying in very sooth this is my son do thou teach him for my sake so hasan abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft and allah opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for himself one day as he sat in his booth in the bazar there came up to him an ajamí a foreigner a persian with a great white beard and a white turband on his head having the semblance of a merchant who after saluting him looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly it pleased him and he shook his head saying by allah thou art a cunning goldsmith what may be thy name hasan replied the other shortly the persian continued to look at his wares whilst hasan read in an old book he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace till the hour of midafternoon prayer when the shop became clear of people and the persian accosted the young man saying o my son thou art a comely youth what book is that thou hast no sire and i have no son and i know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and seventyninth nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian accosted the young man saying o my son thou art a comely youth thou hast no sire and i have no son and i know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world many have sought of me instruction therein but i consented not to instruct any of them in it yet hath my soul consented that i teach it to thee for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and i will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer and anvil charcoal and fire hasan asked o my lord and when wilt thou teach me this and the persian answered tomorrow inshallah i will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of this copper whereupon hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the persian till nightfall when he took leave of him and going in to his mother saluted her with the salam and ate with her but he was dazed without memory or reason for that the strangers words had gotten hold upon his heart so she questioned him and he told her what had passed between himself and the persian which when she heard her heart fluttered and she strained him to her bosom saying o my son beware of hearkening to the talk of the folk and especially of the persians and obey them not in aught for they are sharpers and tricksters who profess the art of alchemy and swindle people and take their money and devour it in vain replied hasan o my mother we are paupers and have nothing he may covet that he should put a cheat on us indeed this persian is a right worthy shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him allah hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son she was silent in her chagrin and he passed the night without sleep his heart being full of what the persian had said to him nor did slumber visit him for the excess of his joy therein but when morning morrowed he rose and taking the keys opened the shop whereupon behold the persian accosted him hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands but he forbade him from this and suffered it not saying o hasan set on the crucible and apply the bellows so he did as the stranger bade him and lighted the charcoal then said the persian o my son hast thou any copper and he replied i have a broken platter so he bade him work the shears and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows till the copper became liquid when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper and opening it sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of somewhat like yellow kohl or eyepowder then he bade hasan blow upon it with the bellows and he did so till the contents of the crucible became a lump of gold when the youth saw this he was stupefied and at his wits end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it pure gold of the finest quality whereupon his reason fled and he was dazed with excess of delight and bent over the persians hand to kiss it but he forbade him saying art thou married and when the youth replied no he said carry this ingot to the market and sell it and take the price in haste and speak not so hasan went down into the market and gave the bar to the broker who took it and rubbed it upon the touchstone and found it pure gold so they opened the biddings at ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up to fifteen thousand dirhams at which price he sold it and taking the money went home and told his mother all that had passed saying o my mother i have learnt this art and mystery but she laughed at him saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightieth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the ajami and cried i have learnt this art and mystery she laughed at him saying there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great and she was silent for vexation then of his ignorance he took a metal mortar and returning to the shop laid it before the persian who was still sitting there and asked him o my son what wilt thou do with this mortar hasan answered let us put it in the fire and make of it lumps of gold the persian laughed and rejoined o my son art thou jinnmad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two ingots of gold in one day knowest thou not that the folk would suspect us and our lives would be lost now o my son an i teach thee this craft thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth for that will suffice thee from year to year cried hasan true o my lord and sitting down in his open shop set on the crucible and cast more charcoal on the fire quoth the persian what wilt thou o my son and quoth hasan teach me this craft there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great exclaimed the persian laughing verily o my son thou art little of wit and in nowise fitted for this noble craft did ever any during all his life learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars if we busy ourselves with it here the folk will say of us these practise alchemy and the magistrates will hear of us and we shall lose our lives wherefore o my son an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright come thou with me to my house so hasan barred his shop and went with that ajamí but by the way he remembered his mothers words and thinking in himself a thousand thoughts he stood still with bowed head the persian turned and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him art thou mad what i in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest i will harm thee presently adding but if thou fear to go with me to my house i will go with thee to thine and teach thee there hasan replied tis well o uncle and the persian rejoined go thou before me so hasan led the way to his own house and entering told his mother of the persians coming for he had left him standing at the door she ordered the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and adorning it her son bade her go to one of the neighbours lodgings so she left her home to them and wended her way whereupon hasan brought in the persian who entered after asking leave then he took in hand a dish and going to the market returned with food which he set before the persian saying eat o my lord that between us there may be bread and salt and may almighty allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and salt the persian replied with a smile true o my son who knoweth the virtue and worth of bread and salt then he came forward and ate with hasan till they were satisfied after which the ajami said o my son hasan bring us somewhat of sweetmeats so hasan went to the market rejoicing in his words and returned with ten saucers of sweetmeats of which they both ate and the persian said may allah abundantly requite thee o my son it is the like of thee with whom folk company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may profit him then said he o hasan bring the gear but hardly did hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass in springtide and hastening to the shop fetched the apparatus and set it before the persian who pulled out a piece of paper and said o hasan by the bond of bread and salt wert thou not dearer to me than my son i would not let thee into the mysteries of this art for i have none of the elixir left save what is in this paper but by and by i will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before thee know o my son hasan that to every ten pounds of copper thou must set half a drachm of that which is in this paper and the whole ten will presently become unalloyed virgin gold presently adding o my son o hasan there are in this paper three ounces egyptian measure and when it is spent i will make thee other and more hasan took the packet and finding therein a yellow powder finer than the first said to the persian o my lord what is the name of this substance and where is it found and how is it made but he laughed longing to get hold of the youth and replied of what dost thou question indeed thou art a froward boy do thy work and hold thy peace so hasan arose and fetching a brass platter from the house shore it in shreds and threw it into the meltingpot then he scattered on it a little of the powder from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold when he saw this he joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think of nothing save the gold but whilst he was occupied with taking up the lumps of metal from the meltingpot the persian pulled out of his turband in haste a packet of cretan bhang which if an elephant smelt he would sleep from night to night and cutting off a little thereof put it in a piece of the sweetmeat then said he o hasan thou art become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth and i have a daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness symmetry and perfect grace now i see that thou befittest none but her and she none but thee wherefore if it be allahs will i will marry thee to her replied hasan i am thy servant and whatso good thou dost with me will be a deposit with the almighty and the persian rejoined o my son have fair patience and fair shall betide thee therewith he gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand put it in his mouth knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time for only the lord of futurity knoweth the future but hardly had he swallowed it when he fell down head foregoing heels and was lost to the world whereupon the persian seeing him in such calamitous case rejoiced exceedingly and cried thou hast fallen into my snares o gallowscarrion o dog of the arabs this many a year have i sought thee and now i have found thee o hasan—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightyfirst nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan the goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the ajami and fell fainting to the ground the persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried this many a year have i sought thee and now i have found thee then he girt himself and pinioned hasans arms and binding his feet to his hands laid him in a chest which he emptied to that end and locked it upon him moreover he cleared another chest and laying therein all hasans valuables together with the piece of the first goldlump and the second ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock then he ran to the market and fetching a porter took up the two chests and made off with them to a place within sight of the city where he set them down on the seashore hard by a vessel at anchor there now this craft had been freighted and fitted out by the persian and her master was awaiting him so when the crew saw him they came to him and bore the two chests on board then the persian called out to the rais or captain saying up and let us be off for i have done my desire and won my wish so the skipper sang out to the sailors saying weigh anchor and set sail and the ship put out to sea with a fair wind so far concerning the persian but as regards hasans mother she awaited him till suppertime but heard neither sound nor news of him so she went to the house and finding it thrown open entered and saw none therein and missed the two chests and their valuables wherefore she knew that her son was lost and that doom had overtaken him and she buffeted her face and rent her raiment crying out and wailing and saying alas my son ah alas the fruit of my vitals ah and she recited these coupletsmy patience fails me and grows anxiety  and with your absence       nbsp     growth of grief i seeby allah patience went what time ye went  loss of all hope how       nbsp     suffer patientlywhen lost my loved one how can joy i sleep  who shall enjoy       nbsp     such life of low degreethou rt gone and desolating house and home  hast fouled the       nbsp     fount erst flowed from foulness freethou wast my fame my grace mid folk my stay  mine aid wast       nbsp     thou in all adversityperish the day when from mine eyes they bore  my friend till       nbsp     sight i thy return to meand she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn when the neighbours came in to her and asked her of her son and she told them what had befallen him with the persian assured that she should never never see him again then she went round about the house weeping and wending she espied two lines written upon the wall so she sent for a scholar who read them to her and they were theseleylas phantom came by night when drowsiness had overcome me       nbsp     towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the       nbsp     desertbut when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom i saw the air       nbsp     vacant and the place of visitation was distantwhen hasans mother heard these lines she shrieked and said yes o my son indeed the house is desolate and the visitationplace is distant then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son went away but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write hasans name and the date of his loss and thenceforward she quitted it not but made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day such was her case but touching her son hasan and the ajami this persian was a magian who hated moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who fell into his power he was a lewd and filthy villain a hankerer after alchemy an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards such an one as he of whom quoth the poeta dog dogfathered by doggrandsire bred  no good in dog       nbsp     from dog race issuedeen for a gnat no restingplace gives he  who is composed of       nbsp     seed by all men shedthe name of this accursed was bahrám the guebre and he was wont every year to take a moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes so when he had carried out his plot against hasan the goldsmith they sailed on from dawn till dark when the ship made fast to the shore for the night and at sunrise when they set sail again bahram bade his black slaves and white servants bring him the chest wherein were hasan they did so and he opened it and taking out the young man made him sniff up vinegar and blew a powder into his nostrils hasan sneezed and vomited the bhang then opening his eyes he looked about him right and left and found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail and saw the persian sitting by him wherefore he knew that the accursed magian had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril against which his mother had warned him so he spake the saying which shall never shame the sayer to wit there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great verity we are allahs and unto him we are returning o my god be thou gracious to me in thine appointment and give me patience to endure this thine affliction o lord of the three worlds then he turned to the persian and bespoke him softly saying o my father what fashion is this and where is the covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to me but bahram stared at him and replied o dog knoweth the like of me bond of bread and salt i have slain of youths like thee a thousand save one and thou shalt make up the thousand and he cried out at him and hasan was silent knowing that the fateshaft had shot him—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightysecond nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that when hasan beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned persian he bespoke him softly but gained naught thereby for the ajami cried out at him in wrath so he was silent knowing that the fateshaft had shot him then the accursed bade loose his pinionbonds and they gave him a little water to drink whilst the magian laughed and said by the virtue of the fire and the light and the shade and the heat methought not thou wouldst fall into my nets but the fire empowered me over thee and helped me to lay hold upon thee that i might win my wish and return and make thee a sacrifice to her so she may accept of me quoth hasan thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt whereupon the magus raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and biting the deck with his foreteeth swooned away whilst the tears trickled down his cheeks then the guebre bade his servants light him a fire and hasan said what wilt thou do with it replied the magian this is the fire lady of light and sparkles bright this it is i worship and if thou wilt worship her even as i verily i will give thee half my monies and marry thee to my maiden daughter thereupon hasan cried angrily at him woe to thee thou art a miscreant magian who to fire dost pray in lieu of the king of omnipotent sway creator of night and day and this is naught but a calamity among creeds at this the magian was wroth and said to him wilt thou not then conform with me o dog of the arabs and enter my faith but hasan consented not to this so the accursed guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire bade his pages throw him flat on his face they did so and he beat him with a hide whip of plaited thongs till his flanks were laid open whilst he cried aloud for aid but none aided him and besought protection but none protected him then he raised his eyes to the allpowerful king and sought of him succour in the name of the chosen prophet and indeed patience failed him his tears ran down his cheeks like rain and he repeated these couplets twainin patience o my god thy doom forecast  ill bear an thereby       nbsp     come thy grace at lasttheyve dealt us wrong transgressed and ordered ill  haply thy       nbsp    grace shall pardon what is pastthen the magian bade his negroslaves raise him to a sitting posture and bring him somewhat of meat and drink so they sat food before him but he consented not to eat or drink and bahram ceased not to torment him day and night during the whole voyage whilst hasan took patience and humbled himself in supplication before almighty allah to whom belong honour and glory whereby the guebres heart was hardened against him they ceased not to sail the sea three months during which time hasan was continually tortured till allah almighty sent forth upon them a foul wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship by reason of the fierce gale whereupon quoth the captain and crew by allah this is all on account of yonder youth who hath been these three months in torture with this magian indeed this is not allowed of god the most high then they rose against the magian and slew his servants and all who were with him which when he saw he made sure of death and feared for himself so he loosed hasan from his bonds and pulling off the ragged clothes the youth had on clad him in others and made excuses to him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native land saying o my son return me not evil for that i have done with thee quoth hasan how can i ever rely upon thee again and quoth bahram o my son but for sin there were no pardon indeed i did all these doings with thee but to try thy patience and thou knowest that the case is altogether in the hands of allah so the crew and captain rejoiced in hasans release and he called down blessings on them and praised the almighty and thanked him with this the wind was stilled and the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage then said hasan to bahram o master whither wendest thou replied the magian o my son i am bound for the mountain of clouds where is the elixir which we use in alchemy and the guebre swore to him by the fire and the light that he had no longer any cause to fear him so hasans heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the persians words he continued to eat and drink and sleep with the magian who clad him in his own raiment they ceased not sailing on other three months when the ship came to anchor off a long shoreline of many coloured pebbles white and yellow and skyblue and black and every other hue and the magian sprang up and said o hasan come let us go ashore for we have reached the place of our wish and will so hasan rose and landed with bahram after the persian had commended his goods to the captains care they walked on inland till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight when bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettledrum of copper and a silken strap worked in gold with characts beat the drum with the strap until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste hasan marvelled at the magians doings and was afraid of him he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed but bahram looked at him and said what aileth thee o my son by the truth of the fire and the light thou hast naught to fear from me and were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means i had not brought thee ashore so rejoice in all good for yonder cloud of dust is the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereof—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightythird nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the persian said to hasan in very sooth yonder dustcloud is the cloud of something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and will make easy to us the hardships thereof presently the dust lifted off three shedromedaries one of which bahram mounted and hasan another then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven days till they came to a wide champaign and descending into its midst they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold so they alighted and entering thereunder ate and drank and took their rest anon hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something lofty said to the magian what is that o nuncle bahram replied tis a palace and quoth hasan wilt thou not go thither that we may enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting it but the persian was wroth and said name not to me yonder palace for therein dwelleth a foe with whom there befel me somewhat whereof this is no time to tell thee then he beat the kettledrum and up came the dromedaries and they mounted and fared on other seven days on the eighth day the magian said o hasan what seest thou hasan replied i see clouds and mists twixt east and west quoth bahram that is neither clouds nor mists but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the clouds split and there are no clouds above it for its exceeding height and surpassing elevation yon mount is my goal and thereon is the need we seek tis for that i brought thee hither for my wish may not be won save at thy hands hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost and said to the magian by the right of that thou worshippest and by the faith wherein thou believest i conjure thee to tell me what is the object wherefor thou hast brought me bahram replied the art of alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split such a site is yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and i purpose to send thee up thither to fetch it and when we have it i will show thee the secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn hasan answered in his fear tis well o my master and indeed he despaired of life and wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two coupletsconsider but thy lord his work shall bring  comfort to thee       nbsp   with quick relief and neardespair not when thou sufferest sorest bane  in bane how many       nbsp   blessed boons appearthey ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that mountain where they halted and hasan saw thereon a palace and asked bahram what be yonder palace whereto he answered tis the abode of the jann and ghuls and satans then the magian alighted and making hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him bear me no ill will anent that i did with thee for i will keep guard over thee in thine ascent to the palace and i conjure thee not to trick and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom and i and thou will share equally therein and hasan replied to hear is to obey then bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of wheat ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks then he took out the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap whereupon up came the dromedaries he chose out one and said hearken o my son o hasan to what i am about to enjoin on thee and hasan replied tis well bahram continued lie down on this skin and i will sew thee up therein and lay thee on the ground whereupon the rakham birds will come to thee and carry thee up to the mountaintop take this knife with thee and when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have set thee down slit open therewith the skin and come forth the vultures will then take fright at thee and fly away whereupon do thou look down from the mountain head and speak to me and i will tell thee what to do so he sewed him up in the skin placing therein three cakes and a leathern bottle full of water and withdrew to a distance presently a vulture pounced upon him and taking him up flew away with him to the mountaintop and there set him down as soon as hasan felt himself on the ground he slit the skin and coming forth called out to the magian who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy saying to him look behind thee and tell me what thou seest hasan looked and seeing many rotten bones and much wood told bahram who said to him this be what we need and seek make six bundles of the wood and throw them down to me for this is wherewithal we do alchemy so he threw him the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to hasan o gallows bird i have won my wish of thee and now if thou wilt thou mayst abide on this mountain or cast thyself down to the earth and perish so saying he left him and went away and hasan exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this hound hath played the traitor with me and he sat bemoaning himself and reciting these coupletswhen god upon a man possessed of reasoning hearing and sight       nbsp   his will in aught to pass would bringhe stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit from       nbsp    him as one draws out the hairs to paste that clingtill his decrees fulfilled he gives him back his wit that       nbsp   therewithal he may receive admonishingso say thou not of aught that haps how happened it for fate       nbsp    and fortune fixed do order everything—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the seven hundred and eightyfourth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the magian sent hasan to the mountaintop and made him throw down all he required he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth exclaimed there is no majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great this damned hound hath played the traitor then he rose to his feet and looked right and left after which he walked on along the mountain top in mind making certain of death he fared on thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain along which he saw a darkblue sea dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves each as it were a lofty mount so he sat down and repeated what he might of the koran and besought allah the most high to ease him of his troubles or by death or by deliverance from such strait then he recited for himself the funeralprayer and cast himself down into the main but the waves bore him up by allahs grace so that he reached the water unhurt and the angel in whose charge is the sea watched over him so that the billows bore him safe to land by the decree of the most high thereupon he rejoiced and praised almighty allah and thanked him after which he walked on in quest of something to eat for stress of hunger and came presently to the place where he had halted with the magian bahram then he fared on awhile till behold he caught sight of a great palace rising high in air and knew it for that of which he had

Kiston,"Sachin-Jigar, Jubin Nautiyal",2021,the vampire in literaturea consideration of the vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal any exhaustive inquiry is wellnigh impossible and this not so much perhaps on account of the wealth of the material although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view it is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghoststories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation to mass the shadows without derangement to be occult yet not to be obscure accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and deathdealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the vampireusing this latter word in its widest sense as one must employ it when speaking of literature a caution which here given as regards this chapter will serve once for all in such a story for example as dr m r james count magnus is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire the writer has left the point ambiguous it is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing it will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain count magnus de la gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrgård even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninetytwo years before two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate they are warned no do not go we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking they should be resting not walking the two men laughed and cried the count is dead we do not care for him but in the night the villagers hear someone scream just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him then they hear a hideous laugh it was not one of those two men that laughed and indeed they have all of them said that it was not any man at all in the morning they go out with the priest and they find one of the men dead killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot he was once a beautiful man but now his face was not there because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones the other man is standing with his back against a tree pushing with his handspushing something away from him which was not therethere was some vague gossip that the count had been on the black pilgrimage and had brought something or someone back with him during his investigation of the papers the english traveller mr wraxall found a liber nigrae peregrinationis or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the count had once journeyed to the city of chorazin and there adored the prince of the air in careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum mr wraxall exclaims ah count magnus there you are i should dearly like to see you he is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide in a state of frenzied fear he sets out for england the next day yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures a man in a long black cloak and a broadleafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood upon landing at harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a crossroad the two horrible creatures he finds a lodging but within the next fortyeight hours his pursuers fall upon him he is discovered dead and in the district it is still remembered how the jury that viewed the body fainted seven of em did and none of em wouldnt speak to what they see and the verdict was visitation of god and how the people as kep the ouse moved out that same week and went away from that partthis story may i think certainly be considered as vampire lore and although it must of course be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural i have related it at some little length here partly because it is told so excellently well and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess it is brief and succinct although there are many details but every touch tells no ghost story should be of any length the horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity the ghost is malevolent and odious in fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree the authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which as we have noticed is of intent left illdefined nothing could be more crude than an explanation and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first orderto review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas and which are in truth but few and unimportant seems to be outside our province here and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folklore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purposesince some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in german universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men thus among the poems of heinrich august ossenfelder we have a short piece entitled der vampir which is as followsmein liebes mägdchen glaubetbeständig steif und festean die gegebnen lehrender immer frommen mutterals völker an der theysean tödtliche vampiereheyduckisch feste glaubennun warte nur christianchendu willst mich gar nich liebenich will mich an dir rächenund heute in tockayerzu einem vampir trinkenund wenn du sanfte schlummerstvon deinen schönen wangenden frischen purpur saugenalsdenn wirst du erschreckenwenn ich dich werde küssenund als ein vampir küssenwann du dann recht erzitterstund matt in meine armegleich einer todten sinkestalsdenn will ich dich fragensind meine lehren besserals deiner guten mutterthe poet wieland has a passing reference to the vampireder jüngling aus den wolkenherab gefallen stumm und bleichals hätt ein vampyr ihm die adern ausgemolkensteht ganz vernichtet von dem streichit would be an exaggeration to say that the vampire entered german literature with goethes famous ballad die braut von korinth but it would be difficult to overestimate the influence and the popularity of this piece the subject of which is directly derived from phlegon of tralles the young athenian who visits his fathers old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride and who declaresaus dem grabe werd ich ausgetriebennoch zu suchen das vermifste gutnoch den schon verlornen mann zu lieben und zu saugen seines herzens blutists um den geschehnmuss nach andern gehnund das junge volk erliegt der wuteven more famous are the charnel horrors of bürgers lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the gottinger musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof brandl gives an ample list has remained a household wordin spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary england for german romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of lenore was published here until 1796 when william taylor of norwich printed in the monthly review of march his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation he had however by his own account written the translation as early as 1790 and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed applauded and much discussed in norwich literary circles we know that mrs barbauld who visited edinburgh about the summer of 1793 or 1794 read aloud taylors version to a number of enthusiastic admirers this event was described to sir walter scott by miss cranstoun afterwards countess purgstall although scott himself mentions that his curiosity was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman who having heard lenore once read in manuscript could only recollect the general outline and part of a couplet which from the singularity of its structure and frequent recurrence had remained impressed on his memory this gentleman was mr cranstoun the brother of countess purgstall and so her statement is no doubt accurate as scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister it was in the course of 1794 or at any rate early in the following year that scott made his own rendering of the ballad the account of taylors version ellenore which electrified the assembled company at dugald stewarts house when read by the famous anna letitia barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original just about this time however it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent and it was not until after some delay that a copy of bürgers works was conveyed to him from hamburg he immediately devoured the german ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about englishing it i well recollect he writes that i began my task after supper and finished it about daybreak next morning scotts friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception in 1796 besides the public issue of the translations from bürger by taylor and by scott no less than three other versions appeared from the several pens of w r spencer h j pye and j t stanley the translation by the last named author was given to the public in an édition de luxe at five shillings as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown in 1797 a pasquil followed miss kitty a parody on lenora a ballad translated from the german by several hands whilst in the following year mrs taylor turned the popular poem into italian as a novella morale probably the most faithful if not the most spirited translation was that by the rev j beresford which was published in 1800it was in 1797 that coleridge wrote the first part of christabel and german critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of lenore since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree for example if the narrative of geraldine be carefully read it must be evident that the following judgment of professor brandl is without foundation this critic writes ihre vorgeschichte of geraldine schöpfte er grossentheils aus bürgers lenore in taylors uebersetzung die dame ist wenigstens ihrer erzählung nach auf einem windschnellen ross entführt und halbtodt vor furcht hier abgesetzt worden statt des schwarzen leichenzuges der lenoren auf ihrem ritt durch die mondnacht aufstiess will sie den schatten der nacht gekreuzt haben noch zittert das verdorrte blatt neben ihr wie aus herzenangstas we might expect the young shelley was enchanted by lenore and medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem which he made with his own hand dowden tells the story how one christmas eve shelley dramatically related the bürger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest that the company fully expected to see wilhelm stalk into the parlour in his study of shelley charles middleton has remarked it is hinted somewhat plausibly that the leonora of bürgher first awakened his poetic faculty a tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination but his earliest pieces written about this time and consisting only of a few ballads are deficient in elegance and originality and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself to suggest as zeiger would have it that lenore influenced the poem which in the romance st irvyne megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison and which commencesghosts of the dead have i not heard your yellingrise on the nightrolling breast of the blast   is the merest ineptitude since these verses are taken almost word for word from lachin y gair in byrons hours of idleness and that had been published some four years previouslyas i have elsewhere shown in some detail shelleys two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to charlotte dacres zofloya or the moor which appeared in 1806 and which as the poet himself declares quite enraptured him it is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as die braut von korinth and lenore the novelists of the gothic school soaked though they were in german literature searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the vampire it is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as monk lewis apollos sexton who would fain make parnassus a churchyard and charles robert maturin who as he himself confessed loved bells rung by viewless hands daggers encrusted with long shed blood treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry mad nuns apparitions et hoc genus omne the two lords of macabre romance should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages in the gothic romance we have horror heaped on horrors head mouldering abbeys haunted castles banditti illuminati sorcerers conspirators murderous monks and phantom friars apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders we have such titles as the famous horrid mysteries the midnight groan the abbot of montserrat or the pool of blood the demon of venice the convent spectre the hag of the mountains and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures but until we come to polidoris novel which will be considered later nowhere so far as i am aware do we meet with the vampire in the realm of gothic fancy so vast however is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that i hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited there may be some romance which i have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims but if such be the case i am at least prepared to say that the vampire was not generally known to gothic lore and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school i think he would have reappeared on many occasions for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines inevitably one of the band t j horseley carties francis lathom william herbert edward montague mrs roche eliza parsons miss m hamilton mrs helme mrs meeke isabella kelley and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the vampire in some funereal episodeone might even have supposed that the notes to southeys thalaba the destroyer must have put them on the track and surely stanzas eight nine and

stoodit is important to remark that in his notes upon this passage southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism particularly from the lettres juives the vampires of gradisch also the history of arnold paul and the very ample account given by tournefort he further says the turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves if any man makes affidavit before a judge that he heard a noise in a mans grave he  is by order dug up and chopped all too pieces the merchants at constantinople once airing on horseback had as usual for protection a janisary with them passing by the burying place of the jews it happened that an old jew sat by a sepulchre the janisary rode up to him and rated him for stinking the world a second time and commanded him to get into his grave againroger norths life of sir dudley northit might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the marquis de sade justine on les malheurs de la vertu and juliette depict scenes of vampirism and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case in the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editionsit was first issued in 1791 2 vols 8vountil it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as la nouvelle justine on les malheurs de la vertu suivie de lhistoire de juliette sa soeur 10 vols 18mo of which justine occupies four and juliette six justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first and the book has been entirely rewritten in justine we have the episodes in the house of monsieur rodin and more particularly the orgies of the comte de gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims as also the cruelties of the monster roland all of which may well be esteemed vampirism many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in juliette and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the muscovite giant minski whose favourite meat is human flesh and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones and cordelli the necrophilist of anconain the new monthly magazine 1 april 1819 was published the vampyre a tale by lord byron which although it may seem to ussteeped in le fanu and m r jamesa little oldfashioned at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence being even more admired and imitated on the continent than in england it was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of lord byron but had been written by dr john william polidori physiciancompanion to the poet byron had as a matter of fact been writing a work of the same title in imitation of mrs shelleys frankenstein but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in galignanis edition of his works a first printed the vampyre forms a part of extracts from a letter from geneva with anecdotes of lord byron here is to be read that among other things which the lady from whom i procured these anecdotes related to me she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by lord byron it appears that one evening lord byron mr p b shelley the two ladies and the gentleman the daughters of godwin and dr polidori before alluded to after having perused a german work which was entitled phantasmagoriana began relating ghost stories when his lordship having recited the beginning of christabel then unpublished the whole took so strong a hold of mr shelleys mind that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room the physician and lord byron followed and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face after having given him something to refresh him upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression it was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency which was undertaken by lord byron the physician and miss m godwin my friend the lady above referred to had in her possession the outline of each of these stories i obtained them as a great favour and herewith forward them to you as i was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself to peruse the ébauches of so great a genius and those immediately under his influence upon this the editor has the following note we have in our possession the tale of dr  as well as the outline of that of miss godwin the latter has already appeared under the title of frankenstein or the modern prometheus the former however upon consulting this author we may probably hereafter give to our readersthe vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition this preamble commences the superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the east among the arabians it appears to be common it did not however extend itself to the greeks until after the establishment of christianity and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the latin and greek churches at which time the idea becoming prevalent that a latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory it gradually increased and formed the subject of many wonderful stories still extant of the dead rising from their graves and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful in the west it spread with some slight variation all over hungary poland austria and lorraine where the belief existed that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims who became emaciated lost their strength and speedily died of consumptions whilst these human bloodsuckers fattenedand their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies and even from the very pores of their skinsthe editor then recounts the famous instance of arnold paul and continues we have related this monstrous rodomontade because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce in many parts of greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earththose to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection this supposition is we imagine alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the giaourbut first on earth as vampyre sentthy corse shall from its tomb be rentthen ghastly haunt thy native placeand suck the blood of all thy racethere from thy daughter sister wife p 283at midnight drain the stream of lifeyet loathe the banquet which perforcemust feed thy livid living corsethy victims ere they yet expireshall know the demon for

gnashing tooth and haggard lipthen stalking to thy sullen gravegoand with ghouls and afrits ravetill these in horror shrink awayfrom spectre more accursed than theyafter an allusion to southeys thalaba tourneforts travels and dom calmets classical work the editor concludes we could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition and we may perhaps resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity for the present we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking that though the term vampyre is the one in most general acceptation there are several other synonimous with it which are made use of in various parts of the world namely vroucolocha vardoulacha goul broucoloka cthe story tells how at the height of a london season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman more remarkable for his singularities than his rank he gazed upon the mirth around him as if he could not participate therein apparently the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned those who felt this sensation of awe could not explain whence it arose some attributed it to the dead grey eye which fixing upon the objects face did not seem to penetrate and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass this original is invited to every house and in the course of the winter he meets a young gentleman of the name of aubrey he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth by parents who died while he was yet in childhood aubrey is greatly fascinated by lord ruthven for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman and intending to travel upon the continent he mentions this intention to my lord and is surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who apparently had nothing in common with other men he gladly accepted it and in a few days they had passed the circling watersas they travelled from town to town aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters broken gamblers and the like but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor however the recipients of this charity inevitably found that there was a curse upon it for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery eventually the travellers arrive at rome and here aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from london the most terrible scandals adulteries and seductions have come to light at rome aubrey is able to foil lord ruthvens plans frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl and then he directed his steps towards greece and crossing the peninsula soon found himself at athens here he lodges in the house of a greek whose daughter ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty as he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with greek legend and tradition and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre who had passed years amidst his friends and dearest ties forced every year by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months his blood would run cold whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies but ianthe cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiends appetite and when she found him so incredulous she begged of him to believe her for it had been remarked that those who had dared to question their existence always had some proof given which obliged them with grief and heartbreaking to confess it was true she detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters and his horror was increased by hearing a pretty accurate description of lord ruthven he however still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of lord ruthvenbefore long it becomes evident that aubrey is in love with ianthe and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of english habits marrying an uneducated greek girl still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him he endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited when ianthes parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen as he must necessarily pass through a wood where no greek would ever remain after the day had closed upon any consideration they described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path aubrey made light of their representations and tried to laugh them out of the idea but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze he was silenthaving given his promise to ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early the exploration however takes longer than he has supposed and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm the steed alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of

Moonrise,Atif Aslam,2024,there was once in time of old a merchant hight abd alrahmán whom allah had blessed with a son and daughter and for their much beauty and loveliness he named the girl kaubab alsabáh and the boy kamar alzamán when he saw what allah had vouchsafed the twain of beauty and loveliness brilliancy and symmetry he feared for them the evil eyes of the espiers and the jibing tongues of the jealous and the craft of the crafty and the wiles of the wicked and shut them up from the folk in a mansion for the space of fourteen years during which time none saw them save their parents and a slavegirl who served them now their father could recite the koran even as allah sent it down as also did his wife wherefore the mother taught her daughter to read and recite it and the father his son till both had gotten it by heart moreover the twain learned from their parents writing and reckoning and all manner of knowledge and polite letters and needed no master when kamar alzaman came to years of manhood the wife said to her husband how long wilt thou keep thy son kamar alzaman sequestered from the eyes of the folk is he a girl or a boy he answered a boy rejoined she an he be a boy why dost thou not carry him to the bazar and seat him in thy shop that he may know the folk and they know him to the intent that it may become notorious among men that he is thy son and do thou teach him to sell and to buy peradventure somewhat may befal thee so shall the folk know him for thy son and he shall lay his hand on thy leavings but an thou die as the case now is and he say to the folk i am the son of the merchant abd alrahman verily they will not believe him but will cry we have never seen thee and we knew not that he had a son wherefore the government will seize thy goods and thy son will be despoiled in like manner the girl i mean to make her known among the folk so may be some one of her own condition may ask her in marriage and we will wed her to him and rejoice in her quoth he i did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the nine hundred and sixtyfourth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the merchants wife spake to him in such wise he replied i did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk and because i love them both and love is jealous exceedingly and well saith he who spoke these versesof my sight i am jealous for thee of me  of thyself of thy            stead of thy destinythough i shrined thee in eyes by the craze of me  in such             nearness irk i should never seethough thou wert by my side all the days of me  till doomsday i             neer had enough of theesaid his wife put thy trust in allah for no harm betideth him whom he protecteth and carry him with thee this very day to the shop then she clad the boy in the costliest clothes and he became a seduction to all who on him cast sight and an affliction to the heart of each lover wight his father took him and carried him to the market whilst all who saw him were ravished with him and accosted him kissing his hand and saluting him with the salam quoth one indeed the sun hath risen in such a place and blazeth in the bazar and another the risingplace of the full moon is in such a quarter and a third the new moon of the festival hath appeared to the creatures of allah and they went on to allude to the boy in talk and call down blessings upon him but his father scolded the folk for following his son to gaze upon him because he was abashed at their talk but he could not hinder one of them from talking so he fell to abusing the boys mother and cursing her because she had been the cause of his bringing him out and as he gazed about he still saw the folk crowding upon him behind and before then he walked on till he reached his shop and opening it sat down and seated his son before him after which he again looked out and found the thoroughfare blocked with people for all the passersby going and coming stopped before the shop to stare at that beautiful face and could not leave him and all the men and women crowded in knots about him applying to themselves the words of him who saidthou madest beauty to spoil mans sprite  and saidst o my           servants fear my reprovebut lovely thou lovest all loveliness  how then shall thy            servants refrain from lovewhen the merchant abd alrahman saw the folk thus crowding about him and standing in rows both women and men to fix eyes upon his son he was sore ashamed and confounded and knew not what to do but presently there came up from the end of the bazar a man of the wandering dervishes clad in haircloth the garb of the pious servants of allah and seeing kamar alzaman sitting there as he were a branch of bán springing from a mound of saffron poured forth copious tears and recited these two coupletsa wand uprising from a sandy knoll  like full moon shining            brightest sheen i sawand said what is thy name replied he lúlú  what asked            i lily and he answered lá láthen the dervish fell to walking now drawing near and now moving away and wiping his gray hairs with his right hand whilst the heart of the crowd was cloven asunder for awe of him when he looked upon the boy his eyes were dazzled and his wit confounded and exemplified in him was the saying of the poetwhile that fairfaced boy abode in the place  moon of             breakfastfête he lit by his facelo there came a shaykh with leisurely pace  a reverend trusting             to allahs grace                          and ascetic signals his gait displaydhe had studied love both by day and night  and had special             knowledge of wrong and rightboth for lad and lass had repined his sprite  and his form like            toothpick was lean and slight                          and old bones with faded skin were oerlaidin such arts our shaykh was an ajamí  with a catamite             ever in companyin the love of woman a platonist he  but in either            versed to the full degree                         and zaynab to him was the same as zayddistraught by the fair he adored the fair  oer springcamp           wailed bewept ruins baredry branch thou hadst deemed him for stress o care  which the            morning breeze swayeth here and there                         for only the stone is all hardness madein the lore of love he was wondrous wise  and wide awake with            allseeing eyesits rough and its smooth he had tried and tries  and hugged buck            and doe in the selfsame guise                          and with greybeard and beardless alike heplaydthen he came up to the boy and gave him a root of sweet basil whereupon his father put forth his hand to his pouch and brought out for him some small matter of silver saying take thy portion o dervish and wend thy ways he took the dirhams but sat down on the masonrybench alongside the shop and opposite the boy and fell to gazing upon him and heaving sigh upon sigh whilst his tears flowed like springs founting the folk began to look at him and remark upon him some saying all dervishes are lewd fellows and other some verily this dervishs heart is set on fire for love of this lad now when abd alrahman saw this case he arose and said to the boy come o my son let us lock up the shop and hie us home for it booteth not to sell and buy this day and may almighty allah requite thy mother that which she hath done with us for she was the cause of all this then said he o dervish rise that i may shut my shop so the dervish rose and the merchant shut his shop and taking his son walked away the dervish and the folk followed them till they reached their place when the boy went in and his father turning to the dervish said to him what wouldst thou o dervish and why do i see thee weep he replied o my lord i would fain be thy guest this night for the guest is the guest of almighty allah quoth the merchant welcome to the guest of god enter o dervish—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the nine hundred and sixtyfifth nightshe pursued it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the merchant the father of kamar alzaman heard the saying of the dervish i am allahs guest he replied welcome to the guest of god enter o dervish but he said to himself an the beggar be enamoured of the boy and sue him for sin needs must i slay him this very night and bury him secretly but an there be no lewdness in him the guest shall eat his portion then he brought him into a saloon where he left him with kamar alzaman after he had said privily to the lad o my son sit thou beside the dervish when i am gone out and sport with him and provoke him to loveliesse and if he seek of thee lewdness i who will be watching you from the window overlooking the saloon will come down to him and kill him so as soon as kamar alzaman was alone in the room with the dervish he sat down by his side and the old man began to look upon him and sigh and weep whenever the lad bespake him he answered him kindly trembling the while and would turn to him groaning and crying and thus he did till supper was brought in when he fell to eating with his eyes on the boy but refrained not from shedding tears when a fourth part of the night was past and talk was ended and sleeptide came abd alrahman said to the lad o my son apply thyself to the service of thine uncle the dervish and gainsay him not and would have gone out but the dervish cried to him o my lord carry thy son with thee or sleep with us answered the merchant nay my son shall lie with thee haply thy soul may desire somewhat and he will look to thy want and wait upon thee then he went out leaving them both together and sat down in an adjoining room which had a window giving upon the saloon such was the case with the merchant but as to the lad as soon as his sire had left them he came up to the dervish and began to provoke him and offer himself to him whereupon he waxed wroth and said what talk is this o my son i take refuge with allah from satan the stoned o my lord indeed this is a denial of thee which pleaseth thee not avaunt from me o my son so saying the dervish arose and sat down at a distance but the boy followed him and threw himself upon him saying why o dervish wilt thou deny thyself the joys of my possession and i with a heart that loveth thee hereupon the dervishs anger redoubled and he said an thou refrain not from me i will summon thy sire and tell him of thy doings quoth the lad my father knoweth my turn for this and it may not be that he will hinder me so heal thou my heart why dost thou hold off from me do i not please thee answered the dervish by allah o my son i will not do this though i be hewn in pieces with sharpedged swords and he repeated the saying of the poetindeed my heart loves all the lovely boys  as girls nor am i             slow to such delightbut though i sight them every night and morn  im neither of            lots folk nor wencherwightthen he shed tears and said arise open the door that i may wend my way for i will lie no longer in this lodging therewith he rose to his feet but the boy caught hold of him saying look at the fairness of my face and the cramoisy of my cheeks and the softness of my sides and the lusciousness of my lips moreover he discovered to him calves that would shame wine and cupcarrier and gazed on him with fixed glance that would baffle enchanter and enchantments for he was passing of loveliness and full of blandishment even as saith of him one of the poets who sangi cant forget him since he rose and showed with fair design           those calves of legs whose pearly shine make light in            nightly gloomwonder not an my flesh uprise as though twere judgmentday              when every shank shall bared be and that is day of             doomthen the boy displayed to him his bosom saying look at my breasts which be goodlier than the breasts of maidens and my lipdews are sweeter than sugarcandy so quit scruple and asceticism and cast off devoutness and abstinence and take thy fill of my possession and enjoy my loveliness fear naught for thou art safe from hurt and leave this hebetude for tis a bad habit and he went on to discover to him his hidden beauties striving to turn the reins of his reason with his bendings in graceful guise whilst the dervish turned away his face and said i seek refuge with allah have some shame o my son this is a forbidden thing i deem and i will not do it no not even in dream the boy pressed upon him but the dervish got free from him and turning towards meccah addressed himself to his devotions now when the boy saw him praying he left him till he had prayed a twobow prayer and saluted when he would have accosted him again but the dervish again repeated the intent and prayed a second twobow prayer and thus he did a third and a fourth and a fifth time quoth the lad what prayers are these art thou minded to take flight upon the clouds thou lettest slip our delight whilst thou passest the whole night in the prayerniche so saying he threw himself upon the dervish and kissed him between the eyes but the shaykh said o my son put satan away from thine estate and take upon thee obedience of the compassionate quoth the other an thou do not with me that which i desire i will call my sire and say to him the dervish is minded to do lewdness with me whereupon he will come in to thee and beat thee till thy bones be broken upon thy flesh all this while abd alrahman was watching with his eyes and hearkening with his ears and he was certified that there was no frowardness in the dervish and he said to himself were he a lewd fellow he had not stood out against all this importunity the boy continued to beguile the dervish and every time he expressed purpose of prayer he interrupted him till at last he waxed wroth with passing wrath and was rough with him and beat him kamar alzaman wept and his father came in and having wiped away his tears and comforted him said to the dervish o my brother since thou art in such case why didst thou weep and sigh when thou sawest my son say me is there a reason for this he replied there is and abd alrahman pursued when i saw thee weep at his sight i deemed evil of thee and bade the boy do with thee thus that i might try thee purposing in myself if i saw thee sue him for sin to come in upon thee and kill thee but when i saw what thou didst i knew thee for one of those who are virtuous to the end now allah upon thee tell me the cause of thy weeping the dervish sighed and said o my lord chafe not a closed wound but the merchant said there is no help but thou tell me and the other began know thou that i am a dervish who wander in the lands and the countries and take warning by the display of the creator of night and day it chanced that one friday i entered the city of bassorah in the undurn—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen it was the nine hundred and sixtysixth nightshe resumed it hath reached me o auspicious king that the dervish said to the merchant know then that i a wandering mendicant chanced one friday to enter the city of bassorah in the undurn and saw the shops open and full of all manner of wares and meat and drink but the place was deserted and therein was neither man nor woman nor girl nor boy nor in the markets and the main streets was there dog or cat nor sounded sound nor friend was found i marvelled at this end and said to myself i wonder whither the people of the city be gone with their cats and dogs and what hath allah done with them now i was anhungred so i took hot bread from a bakers oven and going into the shop of an oilman spread the bread with clarified butter and honey and ate then i entered the shop of a sherbetseller and drank what i would after which seeing a coffeeshop open i went in and found the pots on the fire full of coffee but there was no one there so i drank my fill and said verily this is a wondrous thing it seemeth as though death had stricken the people of this city and they had all died this very hour or as if they had taken fright at something which befel them and fled without having time to shut their shops now whilst pondering this matter lo i heard a sound of a band of drums beating whereat i was afraid and hid myself for a while then looking out through a crevice i saw damsels like moons come walking through the market two by two with uncovered heads and faces displayed they were in forty pairs thus numbering fourscore and in their midst a young lady riding on a horse that could hardly move his legs for that which was upon it of silvern trappings and golden and jewelled housings her face was wholly unveiled and she was adorned with the costliest ornaments and clad in the richest of raiment and about her neck she wore a collar of gems and on her bosom were necklaces of gold her wrists were clasped with bracelets which sparkled like stars and her ankles with bangles of gold set with precious stones the slavegirls walked before her and behind and on her right and left and in front of her was a damsel bearing in baldric a great sword with grip of emerald and tassels of jewelencrusted gold when that young lady came to where i lay hid she pulled up her horse and said o damsels i hear a noise of somewhat within yonder shop so do ye search it lest haply there be one hidden there with intent to enjoy a look at us whilst we have our faces unveiled so they searched the shop opposite the coffeehouse wherein i lay hid whilst i abode in terror and presently i saw them come forth with a man and they said to her o our lady we found a man there and here he is before thee quoth she to the damsel with the sword smite his neck so she went up to him and struck off his head then leaving the dead man lying on the ground they passed on when i saw this i was affrighted but my heart was taken with love of the young lady after an hour or so the people reappeared and every one who had a shop entered it whilst the folk began to come and go about the bazars and gathered around the slain man staring at him as a curiosity then i crept forth from my hiding place by stealth and none took note of me but love of that lady had gotten possession of my heart and i began to enquire of her privily none however gave me news of her so i left bassorah with vitals yearning for her love and when i came upon this thy son i saw him to be the likest of all creatures to the young lady wherefore he reminded me of her and his sight revived the fire of passion in me and kindled anew in my heart the flames of lovelonging and distraction and such is the cause of my shedding tears then he wept with sore weeping till he could no more and said o my lord i conjure thee by allah open the door to me so i may gang my gait accordingly abd alrahman opened the door and he went forth thus fared it with him but as regards kamar alzaman when he heard the dervishs story his heart was taken with love of the lady and passion gat the mastery of him and raged in him longing and distraction so on the morrow he said to his sire all the sons of the merchants wander about the world to attain their desire nor is there one of them but his father provideth for him a stockintrade wherewithal he may travel and traffic for gain why then o my father dost thou not outfit me with merchandise so i may fare with it and find my luck he replied o my son such merchants lack money so they send their sons to foreign parts for the sake of profit and pecuniary gain and provision of the goods of the world but i have monies in plenty nor do i covet more why then should i exile thee indeed i cannot brook to be parted from thee an hour more especially as thou art unique in beauty and loveliness and perfect grace and i fear for thee but kamar alzaman said o my father nothing will serve but thou must furnish me with merchandise wherewithal to travel else will i fly from thee at unawares though without money or merchandise so an thou wish to solace my heart make ready for me a stockintrade that i may travel and amuse myself by viewing the countries of men abd alrahman seeing his son enamoured of travel acquainted his wife with this saying verily thy son would have me provide him with goods so he may fare therewith to far regions albeit travel is travail quoth she what is there to displease thee in this such is the wont of the sons of the merchants and they all vie one with other in glorifying globetrotting and gain quoth he most of the merchants are poor and seek growth of good but i have wealth galore she replied more of a good thing hurteth not and if thou comply not with his wish i will furnish him with goods of my own monies quoth abd alrahman i fear strangerhood for him inasmuch as travel is the worst of trouble but she said there is no harm in strangerhood for him when it leadeth to gaining good and if we consent not our son will go away and we shall seek him and not find him and be dishonoured among the folk the merchant accepted his wifes counsel and provided his son with merchandise to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces whilst his mother gave him a purse containing forty bezelstones jewels of price the least of the value of one of which was five hundred ducats saying o my son be careful of this jewellery for twill be of service to thee thereupon kamar alzaman took the jewels and set out for bassorah—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted saywhen it was the nine hundred and sixtyseventh nightshe said it hath reached me o auspicious king that kamar alzaman took the jewels and set out for bassorah after he had laid them in a belt which he buckled about his waist and he stayed not till there remained aught but a days journey between that city and himself when the arabs came out upon him and stripped him naked and slew his men and servants but he laid himself down among the slain and wallowed in their blood so that the wildlings took him for dead and left him without even turning him over and made off with their booty when the arabs had gone their ways kamar alzaman arose having naught left but the jewels in his girdle and fared on nor ceased faring till he came to bassorah it chanced that his entry was on a friday and the town was void of folk even as the dervish had informed him he found the marketstreets deserted and the shops wide open and full of goods so he ate and drank and looked about him presently he heard a band of drums beating and hid himself in a shop till the slavegirls came up when he looked at them and seeing the young lady riding amongst them love and longing overcame him and desire and distraction overpowered him so that he had no force to stand after awhile the people reappeared and the bazars filled whereupon he went to the market and repairing to a jeweller and pulling out one of his forty gems sold it for a thousand dinars wherewith he returned to his place and passed the night there and when morning morrowed he changed his clothes and going to the hamman came forth as he were the full moon then he sold other four stones for four thousand dinars and sauntered solacing himself about the main streets of bassorah clad in the costliest of clothes till he came to a market where he saw a barbers shop so he went in to the barber who shaved his head and clapping up an acquaintance with him said to him o my father i am a stranger in these parts and yesterday i entered this city and found it void of folk nor was there in it any living soul man nor jinni then i saw a troop of slavegirls and amongst them a young lady riding in state and he went on to tell him all he had seen said the barber o my son hast thou told any but me of this and he said no the other rejoined then o my son beware thou mention this before any but me for all folk cannot keep a secret and thou art but a little lad and i fear lest the talk travel from man to man till it reach those whom it concerneth and they slay thee for know o my son that this thou hast seen none ever kenned nor knew in other than this city as for the people of bassorah they are dying of this annoy for every friday forenoon they shut up the dogs and cats to hinder them from going about the marketstreets and all the people of the city enter the cathedralmosques where they lock the doors on them and not one of them can pass about the bazar nor even look out of casement nor knoweth any the cause of this calamity but o my son tonight i will question my wife concerning the reason thereof for she is a midwife and entereth the houses of the notables and knoweth all the city news so inshallah do thou come to me tomorrow and i will tell thee what she shall have told me with this kamar alzaman pulled out a handful of gold and said to him o my father take this gold and give it to thy wife for she is become my mother then he gave him a second handful saying take this for thyself whereupon quoth the barber o my son sit thou in thy place till i go to my wife and ask her and bring the news of the true state of the case so saying he left him in the shop and going home acquainted his wife with the young mans case saying i would have thee tell me the truth of this citybusiness so i may report it to this young merchant for he hath set his heart on weeting the reason why men and beasts are forbidden the marketstreets every friday forenoon and methinks he is a lover for he is openhanded and liberal and if we tell him what he would trow we shall get great good of him quoth she go back and say to him come speak with thy mother my wife who sendeth her salam to thee and saith to thee thy wish is won accordingly he returned to the shop where he found kamar alzaman sitting awaiting him and repeated him the very words spoken by his spouse then he carried him in to her and she welcomed him and bade him sit down whereupon he pulled out an hundred ducats and gave them to her saying o my mother tell me who this young lady may be said she know o my son that there came a gem to the sultan of bassorah from the king of hind and he was minded to have it pierced so he summoned all the jewellers in a body and said to them i wish you to drill me this jewel whoso pierceth it i will give him whatsoever he shall ask but if he break it i will cut off his head at this they were afraid and said o king of the age a jewel is soon spoilt and there are few who can pierce them without injury for most of them have a flaw so do not thou impose upon us a task to which we are unable for our hands cannot avail to drill this jewel however our shaykh is more experienced than we asked the king and who is your shaykh and they answered master obayd he is more versed than we in this art and hath wealth galore and of skill great store therefore do thou send for him to the presence and bid him pierce thee this jewel accordingly the king sent for obayd and bade him pierce the jewel imposing on him the condition aforesaid he took it and pierced it to the liking of the king who said to him ask a boon of me o master and said he o king of the age allow me delay till tomorrow now the reason of this was that he wished to take counsel with his wife who is the young lady thou sawest riding in procession for he loveth her with exceeding love and of the greatness of his affection for her he doth naught without consulting her wherefore he put off asking till the morrow when he went home he said to her i have pierced the king a jewel and he hath granted me a boon which i deferred asking till tomorrow that i might consult thee now what dost thou wish that i may ask it quoth she we have riches such as fires may not consume but an thou love me ask of the king to make proclamation in the streets of bassorah that all the townsfolk shall every friday enter the mosques two hours before the hour of prayer so none may abide in the town at all great or small except they be in the mosques or in the houses and the doors be locked upon them and that every shop of the town be left open then will i ride with my slavewomen through the heart of the city and none shall look on me from window or lattice and every one whom i find abroad i will kill so he went in to the king and begged of him this boon which he granted him and caused proclamation to be made amongst the bassorites—and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted saywhen is was the nine hundred and sixtyeighth nightshe continued it hath reached me o auspicious king that the barbers wife said when the jeweller begged his boon the king bade proclamation be made amongst the bassorites but the people objected that they feared for their goods from the cats and dogs wherefore he commanded to shut the animals up till the folk should come forth from the friday prayers so the jewellers wife fell to sallying forth every friday two hours before the time of congregational prayer and riding in state through the city with her women during which time none dareth pass through the marketplace nor look out of casement or lattice this then is what thou wouldest know and i have told thee who she is but o my son was it thy desire only to have news of her or hast thou a mind to meet her answered he o my mother tis my wish to foregather with her quoth she tell me what valuables thou hast with thee and quoth he o my mother i have with me precious stones of four sorts the first worth five hundred dinars each the second seven hundred the third eight hundred and the fourth a thousand ducats she asked art thou willing to spend four of these and he answered i am ready to spend all of them she rejoined then arise o my son and go straight to thy lodging and take a bezelgem of those worth five hundred sequins with which do thou repair to the jewel market and ask for the shop of master obayd the shaykh of the jewellers go thither and thou wilt find him seated in his shop clad in rich clothes with workmen under his hand salute him and sit down on the front shelf of his shop then pull out the jewel and give it to him saying o master take this stone and fashion it into a sealring for me with gold make it not large a miskál in weight and no more but let the fashion of it be thy fairest then give him twenty dinars and to each of his prentices a dinar sit with him awhile and talk with him and if a beggar approach thee show thy generosity by giving him a dinar to the intent that he may affect thee and after this leave him and return to thy place pass the night there and next morning take an hundred dinars and bring them and give them to thy father the barber for he is poor quoth kamar alzaman be it so and returning to his caravanserai took a jewel worth five hundred gold pieces and went with it to the jewelbazar there he enquired for the shop of master obayd shaykh of the jewellers and they directed him thereto so he went thither and saw the shaykh a man of austere aspect and robed in sumptuous raiment with four journeymen under his hand he addressed him with peace be upon you and the jeweller returned his greeting and welcoming him made him sit down then he brought out the jewel and said o master i wish thee to make me this jewel into a sealring with gold let it be the weight of a miskal and no more but fashion it excellently then he pulled out twenty dinars and gave them to him saying this is the fee for chasing and the price of the ring shall remain and he gave each of the apprentices a gold piece wherefore they loved him and so did master obayd then he sat talk
