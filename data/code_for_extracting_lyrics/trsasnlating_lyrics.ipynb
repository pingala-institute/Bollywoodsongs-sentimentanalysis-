      "Error translating text: He had been sitting there for an hour and a half already, and all that time his imagination had been busy picturing his Moscow rooms, his Moscow friends, his man Pyotr, and his writing-table. He gazed half wonderingly at the dark, motionless trees, and it seemed strange to him that he was living now, not in his summer villa at Sokolniki, but in a provincial town in a house by which a great herd of cattle was driven every morning and evening, accompanied by terrible clouds of dust and the blowing of a horn. He thought of long conversations in which he had taken part quite lately in Moscow—conversations in which it had been maintained that one could live without love, that passionate love was an obsession, that finally there is no such love, but only a physical attraction between the sexes—and so on, in the same style; he remembered them and thought mournfully that if he were asked now what love was, he could not have found an answer.,,The service was over, the people began to appear. Laptev strained his eyes gazing at the dark figures. The bishop had been driven by in his carriage, the bells had stopped ringing, and the red and green lights in the belfry were one after another extinguished— there had been an illumination, as it was dedication day—but the people were still coming out, lingering, talking, and standing under the windows. But at last Laptev heard a familiar voice, his heart began beating violently, and he was overcome with despair on seeing that Yulia Sergeyevna was not alone, but walking with two ladies.,,\"It's awful, awful!\" he whispered, feeling jealous. \"It's awful!\",,At the corner of the lane, she stopped to say good-bye to the ladies, and while doing so glanced at Laptev.,,\"I was coming to see you,\" he said. \"I'm coming for a chat with your father. Is he at home?\",,\"Most likely,\" she answered. \"It's early for him to have gone to the club.\",,There were gardens all along the lane, and a row of lime-trees growing by the fence cast a broad patch of shadow in the moonlight, so that the gate and the fences were completely plunged in darkness on one side, from which came the sounds of women whispering, smothered laughter, and someone playing softly on a balalaika. There was a fragrance of lime-flowers and of hay. This fragrance and the murmur of the unseen whispers worked upon Laptev. He was all at once overwhelmed with a passionate longing to throw his arms round his companion, to shower kisses on her face, her hands, her shoulders, to burst into sobs, to fall at her feet and to tell her how long he had been waiting for her. A faint scarcely perceptible scent of incense hung about her; and that scent reminded him of the time when he, too, believed in God and used to go to evening service, and when he used to dream so much of pure romantic love. And it seemed to him that, because this girl did not love him, all possibility of the happiness he had dreamed of then was lost to him forever.,,She began speaking sympathetically of the illness of his sister, Nina Fyodorovna. Two months before his sister had undergone an operation for cancer, and now every one was expecting a return of the disease.,,\"I went to see her this morning,\" said Yulia Sergeyevna, \"and it seemed to me that during the last week she has, not exactly grown thin, but has, as it were, faded.\",,\"Yes, yes,\" Laptev agreed. \"There's no return of the symptoms, but every day I notice she grows weaker and weaker, and is wasting before my eyes. I don't understand what's the matter with her.\",,\"Oh dear! And how strong she used to be, plump and rosy!\" said Yulia Sergeyevna after a moment's silence. \"Every one here used to call her the Moscow lady. How she used to laugh! On holidays she used to dress up like a peasant girl, and it suited her so well.\",,Doctor Sergey Borisovitch was at home; he was a stout, red-faced man, wearing a long coat that reached below his knees, and looking as though he had short legs. He was pacing up and down his study, with his hands in his pockets, and humming to himself in an undertone, \"Ru-ru-ru-ru.\" His grey whiskers looked unkempt, and his hair was unbrushed, as though he had just got out of bed. And his study with pillows on the sofa, with stacks of papers in the corners, and with a dirty invalid poodle lying under the table, produced the same impression of unkemptness and untidiness as himself.,\"M. Laptev wants to see you,\" his daughter said to him, going into his study.,,\"Ru-ru-ru-ru,\" he hummed louder than ever, and turning into the drawing-room, gave his hand to Laptev, and asked: \"What good news have you to tell me?\",,It was dark in the drawing-room. Laptev, still standing with his hat in his hand, began apologising for disturbing him; he asked what was to be done to make his sister sleep at night, and why she was growing so thin; and he was embarrassed by the thought that he had asked those very questions at his visit that morning.,,\"Tell me,\" he said, \"wouldn't it be as well to send for some specialist on internal diseases from Moscow? What do you think of it?\",,The doctor sighed, shrugged his shoulders, and made a vague gesture with his hands.,,It was evident that he was offended. He was a very huffy man, prone to take offence, and always ready to suspect that people did not believe in him, that he was not recognised or properly respected, that his patients exploited him, and that his colleagues showed him ill-will. He was always jeering at himself, saying that fools like him were only made for the public to ride rough-shod over them.,,Yulia Sergeyevna lighted the lamp. She was tired out with the service, and that was evident from her pale, exhausted face, and her weary step. She wanted to rest. She sat down on the sofa, put her hands on her lap, and sank into thought. Laptev knew that he was ugly, and now he felt as though he were conscious of his ugliness all over his body. He was short, thin, with ruddy cheeks, and his hair had grown so thin that his head felt cold. In his expression there was none of that refined simplicity which makes even rough, ugly faces attractive; in the society of women, he was awkward, over-talkative, affected. And now he almost despised himself for it. He must talk that Yulia Sergeyevna might not be bored in his company. But what about? About his sister's illness again?,,And he began to talk about medicine, saying what is usually said. He approved of hygiene, and said that he had long ago wanted to found a night-refuge in Moscow—in fact, he had already calculated the cost of it. According to his plan the workmen who came in the evening to the night-refuge were to receive a supper of hot cabbage soup with bread, a warm, dry bed with a rug, and a place for drying their clothes and their boots.,,Yulia Sergeyevna was usually silent in his presence, and in a strange way, perhaps by the instinct of a lover, he divined her thoughts and intentions. And now, from the fact that after the evening service she had not gone to her room to change her dress and drink tea, he deduced that she was going to pay some visit elsewhere.,,\"But I'm in no hurry with the night-refuge,\" he went on, speaking with vexation and irritability, and addressing the doctor, who looked at him, as it were, blankly and in perplexity, evidently unable to understand what induced him to raise the question of medicine and hygiene. \"And most likely it will be a long time, too, before I make use of our estimate. I fear our night-shelter will fall into the hands of our pious humbugs and philanthropic ladies, who always ruin any undertaking.\",,Yulia Sergeyevna got up and held out her hand to Laptev.,,\"Excuse me,\" she said, \"it's time for me to go. Please give my love to your sister.\",,\"Ru-ru-ru-ru,\" hummed the doctor. \"Ru-ru-ru-ru.\",Yulia Sergeyevna went out, and after staying a little longer, Laptev said good-bye to the doctor and went home. When a man is dissatisfied and feels unhappy, how trivial seem to him the shapes of the lime-trees, the shadows, the clouds, all the beauties of nature, so complacent, so indifferent! By now the moon was high up in the sky, and the clouds were scudding quickly below. \"But how naïve and provincial the moon is, how threadbare and paltry the clouds!\" thought Laptev. He felt ashamed of the way he had talked just now about medicine, and the night-refuge. He felt with horror that next day he would not have will enough to resist trying to see her and talk to her again, and would again be convinced that he was nothing to her. And the day after—it would be the same. With what object? And how and when would it all end?,,At home he went in to see his sister. Nina Fyodorovna still looked strong and gave the impression of being a well-built, vigorous woman, but her striking pallor made her look like a corpse, especially when, as now, she was lying on her back with her eyes closed; her eldest daughter Sasha, a girl of ten years old, was sitting beside her reading aloud from her reading-book.,,\"Alyosha has come,\" the invalid said softly to herself.,,There had long been established between Sasha and her uncle a tacit compact, to take turns in sitting with the patient. On this occasion Sasha closed her reading-book, and without uttering a word, went softly out of the room. Laptev took an historical novel from the chest of drawers, and looking for the right page, sat down and began reading it aloud.,,Nina Fyodorovna was born in Moscow of a merchant family. She and her two brothers had spent their childhood and early youth, living at home in Pyatnitsky Street. Their childhood was long and wearisome; her father treated her sternly, and had even on two or three occasions flogged her, and her mother had had a long illness and died. The servants were coarse, dirty, and hypocritical; the house was frequented by priests and monks, also hypocritical; they ate and drank and coarsely flattered her father, whom they did not like. The boys had the good-fortune to go to school, while Nina was left practically uneducated. All her life she wrote an illegible scrawl, and had read nothing but historical novels. Seventeen years ago, when she was twenty-two, on a summer holiday at Himki, she made the acquaintance of her present husband, a landowner called Panaurov, had fallen in love with him, and married him secretly against her father's will. Panaurov, a handsome, rather impudent fellow, who whistled and lighted his cigarette from the holy lamp, struck the father as an absolutely worthless person. And when the son-in-law began in his letters demanding a dowry, the old man wrote to his daughter that he would send her furs, silver, and various articles that had been left at her mother's death, as well as thirty thousand roubles, but without his paternal blessing. Later he sent another twenty thousand. This money, as well as the dowry, was spent; the estate had been sold and Panaurov moved with his family to the town and got a job in a provincial government office. In the town he formed another tie, and had a second family, and this was the subject of much talk, as his illicit family was not a secret.,,Nina Fyodorovna adored her husband. And now, listening to the historical novel, she was thinking how much she had gone through in her life, how much she had suffered, and that if any one were to describe her life it would make a very pathetic story. As the tumour was in her breast, she was persuaded that love and her domestic grief were the cause of her illness, and that jealousy and tears had brought her to her hopeless state.,,At last Alexey Fyodorovitch closed the book and said:,,\"That's the end, and thank God for it. To-morrow we'll begin a new one.\",,Nina Fyodorovna laughed. She had always been given to laughter, but of late Laptev had begun to notice that at moments her mind seemed weakened by illness, and she would laugh at the smallest trifle, and even without any cause at all.,,\"Yulia came before dinner while you were out,\" she said. \"So far as I can see, she hasn't much faith in her papa. 'Let papa go on treating you,' she said, 'but write in secret to the holy elder to pray for you, too.' There is a holy man somewhere here. Yulia forgot her parasol here; you must take it to her to-morrow,\" she went on after a brief pause. \"No, when the end comes, neither doctors nor holy men are any help.\",,\"Nina, why can't you sleep at night?\" Laptev asked, to change the subject.,,\"Oh, well, I don't go to sleep—that's all. I lie and think.\",,\"What do you think about, dear?\",\"About the children, about you . . . about my life. I've gone through a great deal, Alyosha, you know. When one begins to remember and remember. . . . My God!\" She laughed. \"It's no joke to have borne five children as I have, to have buried three. . . Sometimes I was expecting to be confined while my Grigory Nikolaitch would be sitting at that very time with another woman. There would be no one to send for the doctor or the midwife. I would go into the passage or the kitchen for the servant, and there Jews, tradesmen, moneylenders, would be waiting for him to come home. My head used to go round . . . . He did not love me, though he never said so openly. Now I've grown calmer—it doesn't weigh on my heart; but in old days, when I was younger, it hurt me—ach! how it hurt me, darling! Once— while we were still in the country—I found him in the garden with a lady, and I walked away. . . I walked on aimlessly, and I don't know how, but I found myself in the church porch. I fell on my knees: 'Queen of Heaven!' I said. And it was night, the moon was shining. . . .\",,She was exhausted, she began gasping for breath. Then, after resting a little, she took her brother's hand and went on in a weak, toneless voice:,,\"How kind you are, Alyosha! . . . And how clever! . . . What a good man you've grown up into!\",,At midnight Laptev said good-night to her, and as he went away he took with him the parasol that Yulia Sergeyevna had forgotten. In spite of the late hour, the servants, male and female, were drinking tea in the dining-room. How disorderly! The children were not in bed, but were there in the dining-room, too. They were all talking softly in undertones, and had not noticed that the lamp was smoking and would soon go out. All these people, big and little, were disturbed by a whole succession of bad omens and were in an oppressed mood. The glass in the hall had been broken, the samovar had been buzzing every day, and, as though on purpose, was even buzzing now. They were describing how a mouse had jumped out of Nina Fyodorovna's boot when she was dressing. And the children were quite aware of the terrible significance of these omens. The elder girl, Sasha, a thin little brunette, was sitting motionless at the table, and her face looked scared and woebegone, while the younger, Lida, a chubby fair child of seven, stood beside her sister looking from under her brows at the light.,,Laptev went downstairs to his own rooms in the lower storey, where under the low ceilings it was always close and smelt of geraniums. In his sitting-room, Panaurov, Nina Fyodorovna's husband, was sitting reading the newspaper. Laptev nodded to him and sat down opposite. Both sat still and said nothing. They used to spend whole evenings like this without speaking, and neither of them was in the least put out by this silence.,,The little girls came down from upstairs to say good-night. Deliberately and in silence, Panaurov made the sign of the cross over them several times, and gave them his hand to kiss. They dropped curtsies, and then went up to Laptev, who had to make the sign of the cross and give them his hand to kiss also. This ceremony with the hand-kissing and curtsying was repeated every evening.,,When the children had gone out Panaurov laid aside the newspaper and said:,,\"It's not very lively in our God-fearing town! I must confess, my dear fellow,\" he added with a sigh, \"I'm very glad that at last you've found some distraction.\",,\"What do you mean?\" asked Laptev.,,\"I saw you coming out of Dr. Byelavin's Just now. I expect you don't go there for the sake of the papa.\",,\"Of course not,\" said Laptev, and he blushed.,,\"Well, of course not. And by the way, you wouldn't find such another old brute as that papa if you hunted by daylight with a candle. You can't imagine what a foul, stupid, clumsy beast he is! You cultured people in the capitals are still interested in the provinces only on the lyrical side, only from the paysage and Poor Anton point of view, but I can assure you, my boy, there's nothing logical about it; there's nothing but barbarism, meanness, and nastiness—that's all. Take the local devotees of science—the local intellectuals, so to speak. Can you imagine there are here in this town twenty-eight doctors? They've all made their fortunes, and they are living in houses of their own, and meanwhile the population is in just as helpless a condition as ever. Here, Nina had to have an operation, quite an ordinary one really, yet we were obliged to get a surgeon from Moscow; not one doctor here would undertake it. It's beyond all conception. They know nothing, they understand nothing. They take no interest in anything. Ask them, for instance, what cancer is—what it is, what it comes from.\",,And Panaurov began to explain what cancer was. He was a specialist on all scientific subjects, and explained from a scientific point of view everything that was discussed. But he explained it all in his own way. He had a theory of his own about the circulation of the blood, about chemistry, about astronomy. He talked slowly, softly, convincingly.,,\"It's beyond all conception,\" he pronounced in an imploring voice, screwing up his eyes, sighing languidly, and smiling as graciously as a king, and it was evident that he was very well satisfied with himself, and never gave a thought to the fact that he was fifty.,,\"I am rather hungry,\" said Laptev. \"I should like something savoury.\",,\"Well, that can easily be managed.\",,Not long afterwards Laptev and his brother-in-law were sitting upstairs in the dining-room having supper. Laptev had a glass of vodka, and then began drinking wine. Panaurov drank nothing. He never drank, and never gambled, yet in spite of that he had squandered all his own and his wife's property, and had accumulated debts. To squander so much in such a short time, one must have, not passions, but a special talent. Panaurov liked dainty fare, liked a handsome dinner service, liked music after dinner, speeches, bowing footmen, to whom he would carelessly fling tips of ten, even twenty-five roubles. He always took part in all lotteries and subscriptions, sent bouquets to ladies of his acquaintance on their birthdays, bought cups, stands for glasses, studs, ties, walking-sticks, scents, cigarette-holders, pipes, lap-dogs, parrots, Japanese bric-à-brac, antiques; he had silk nightshirts, and a bedstead made of ebony inlaid with mother-of-pearl. His dressing-gown was a genuine Bokhara, and everything was to correspond; and on all this there went every day, as he himself expressed, \"a deluge\" of money.,,At supper he kept sighing and shaking his head.,,\"Yes, everything on this earth has an end,\" he said softly, screwing up his dark eyes. \"You will fall in love and suffer. You will fall out of love; you'll be deceived, for there is no woman who will not deceive; you will suffer, will be brought to despair, and will be faithless too. But the time will come when all this will be a memory, and when you will reason about it coldly and look upon it as utterly trivial. . . .\",,Laptev, tired, a little drunk, looked at his handsome head, his clipped black beard, and seemed to understand why women so loved this pampered, conceited, and physically handsome creature.,,After supper Panaurov did not stay in the house, but went off to his other lodgings. Laptev went out to see him on his way. Panaurov was the only man in the town who wore a top-hat, and his elegant, dandified figure, his top-hat and tan gloves, beside the grey fences, the pitiful little houses, with their three windows and the thickets of nettles, always made a strange and mournful impression.,,After saying good-bye to him Laptev returned home without hurrying. The moon was shining brightly; one could distinguish every straw on the ground, and Laptev felt as though the moonlight were caressing his bare head, as though some one were passing a feather over his hair.,,\"I love!\" he pronounced aloud, and he had a sudden longing to run to overtake Panaurov, to embrace him, to forgive him, to make him a present of a lot of money, and then to run off into the open country, into a wood, to run on and on without looking back.,,At home he saw lying on the chair the parasol Yulia Sergeyevna had forgotten; he snatched it up and kissed it greedily. The parasol was a silk one, no longer new, tied round with old elastic. The handle was a cheap one, of white bone. Laptev opened it over him, and he felt as though there were the fragrance of happiness about him.,,He settled himself more comfortably in his chair, and still keeping hold of the parasol, began writing to Moscow to one of his friends:,,\"DEAR PRECIOUS KOSTYA,,,\"Here is news for you: I'm in love again! I say again, because six years ago I fell in love with a Moscow actress, though I didn't even succeed in making her acquaintance, and for the last year and a half I have been living with a certain person you know—a woman neither young nor good-looking. Ah, my dear boy, how unlucky I am in love. I've never had any success with women, and if I say again it's simply because it's rather sad and mortifying to acknowledge even to myself that my youth has passed entirely without love, and that I'm in love in a real sense now for the first time in my life, at thirty-four. Let it stand that I love again.,,\"If only you knew what a girl she was! She couldn't be called a beauty—she has a broad face, she is very thin, but what a wonderful expression of goodness she has when she smiles! When she speaks, her voice is as clear as a bell. She never carries on a conversation with me—I don't know her; but when I'm beside her I feel she's a striking, exceptional creature, full of intelligence and lofty aspirations. She is religious, and you cannot imagine how deeply this touches me and exalts her in my eyes. On that point I am ready to argue with you endlessly. You may be right, to your thinking; but, still, I love to see her praying in church. She is a provincial, but she was educated in Moscow. She loves our Moscow; she dresses in the Moscow style, and I love her for that—love her, love her . . . . I see you frowning and getting up to read me a long lecture on what love is, and what sort of woman one can love, and what sort one cannot, and so on, and so on. But, dear Kostya, before I was in love I, too, knew quite well what love was.,,\"My sister thanks you for your message. She often recalls how she used to take Kostya Kotchevoy to the preparatory class, and never speaks of you except as poor Kostya, as she still thinks of you as the little orphan boy she remembers. And so, poor orphan, I'm in love. While it's a secret, don't say anything to a 'certain person.' I think it will all come right of itself, or, as the footman says in Tolstoy, will 'come round.'\",,When he had finished his letter Laptev went to bed. He was so tired that he couldn't keep his eyes open, but for some reason he could not get to sleep; the noise in the street seemed to prevent him. The cattle were driven by to the blowing of a horn, and soon afterwards the bells began ringing for early mass. At one minute a cart drove by creaking; at the next, he heard the voice of some woman going to market. And the sparrows twittered the whole time.Embed --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

He popped off right?!\",\"Man that pussy nigga ain't do nothing....he laughed\",Then pops stay in the yard trying to play tough, wrinkle his face up,People walking by whispering, ain't no director to say cut,He got a son named Terraneo and he straight butt,,,This lying ass nigga!,That's why I never would trust you,My bitch right here, does she look anything like Ms. Hustle?,He said he gon' kill-k-k-k-k-kill-kill Calicoe,He gon' kill-k-k-k-k-kill-kill Calicoe,Grab the steel, p-p-p-p-peel then Math'll go,Blast the fo', fuck it we could turn it to a casket show,Honestly Math, on a skill scale you Average Joe,You was nice with that Heat so why'd you run into this Maverick for?,I had a feeling he was gon' come here and try and cop out,That's when I start squeezing I guarantee he tap out,That's when he start bleeding as soon as these bullets pop out,The heart gon' fail Math and that's exactly when it drop out,What you bout 6'6\"?,It don't even matter you still a big bitch,Talking tough on that field gon' get you lynched quick,Cause when I'm spazzing I turn Math into Madden, hit stick,Just  thinking it's all greasy like a fish stick,I'm taking all of the bullets to the house, big 6,Dip shit, this nigga really got me fucked up,Like I ain't deserve to battle Math, niggas acting like I lucked up,Talking about who he should battle, you niggas should shut the fuck up,Cause nigga who you would've battled I'd kill Loaded Lux what the fuck's up?,Landslide!,I remember saying, \"What up Math? I got love for old niggas.\",Not saying what they wanted me to say to get here,I told you up in my first round I'm a gold digger,Now I'm exactly what I wanna be, kinda loving my status,Two fully autos you could call my mathematics (Math e 'matics),Any clip I fill Math can have it,I'm tired of niggas walking around like Math's a savage,Walking 'round like you'se a motherfuckin' boss nigga,All y'all soft, you just the toughest out the soft niggas,In other words, either way it go you taking a loss nigga,I don't fuck with Math so it's not a problem for me to cross niggas,He had four battles, boom, everyone of 'em... he lost nigga,He been taking a lot of shots and lately you've been off nigga,So when I go get that iron it ain't golf nigga,This K will knock down the walls in your crib, turn an apartment to a loft nigga,It's fucked up cause my straps filled with flame,Make one false move and these caps peel your brain,Even if you a wifey these caps steal your dame,And you ain't a gangsta cause the fact still remains,But it's not through Math, I chill and wait at the spot,Soon as he pull up, bang! Let that eight straight in his top,But that ain't where it stop, at the funeral and at the casket,With a 4-6 defense when I put eight in a box,Now niggas wanna talk about my pops?,Why niggas wanna talk about my pops?,Y'all think it's real to disrespect a real nigga?,He doing time in the Feds right now and he done actually killed niggas,That mean he done left niggas leaking with the chrome,And turned around and got more time for speaking on the phone,You just ain't a street nigga if you don't feel that,So many fake niggas faking I don't even know why I still rap,You already know how I feel Smack!,You better have that battle in Detroit, ain't nobody gon' get killed Smack!,See I just killed Justin in front of y'all and made him feel wack,Cause it's a difference between metaphors and real rap,LANDSLIDE!Embed --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.,,Acknowledgments,,This is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.,R'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.,Lisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.,Mary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third,and passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.,And Molly was right.,My daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.,My wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final,page.,I am blessed among men.,,,I,My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.,When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.,People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.,Above all-we were wet.,Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.,It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.,From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.,The rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.,Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the,rain.,My father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County,Antrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.,When I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.,Because of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.,After wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.,My mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.,After a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?,Nobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.,He's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles,a bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.,Grandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.,She runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.,Little Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.,My mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.,My grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.,St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.,Ah, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.,And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.,Love her as in childhood,Though feeble, old and grey.,For you'll never miss a mother's love,Till she's buried beneath the clay.,At the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.,She arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.,With Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.,A knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.,That knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.,Delia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.,Steps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.,Malachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.,Philomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.,Jimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.,Delia said, You shuddup.,Tommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.,Och, I am, said Malachy. I am.,Nobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.,And while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.,Malachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little,talk.,Take the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.,Philomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than,you are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.,Jimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.,You shuddup, said Delia.,Another thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd,manner.,Malachy smiled. I do?,about,You do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.,'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.,Och, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry,that girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.,Och, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.,There's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.,You shuddup, said Delia.,Malachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.,Bet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.,Malachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.,He awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.,On the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.,Not until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.,There was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.,After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.,Malachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.,At Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say,that... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.,If I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?,I am, Philomena.,A year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.,The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.,Their husbands agreed.,I'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.,Up, down, up, down.,Malachy goes up.,I get off.,Malachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is,on his mouth and there's blood.,Oh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.,And here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly,slows her.,She says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?,In the middle of the day?,She pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.,My father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside,the child?,did.,our building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a,dog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.,Malachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.,I pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the,dog.,Oh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All,the same blood.,Minnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She,tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.,Mr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.,Will Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?,It was his time, Francis.,The apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother,shakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other,room.,My father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white,enamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.,Dad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?,Cuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story,when you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.,I say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a,different name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?,Setanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.,That's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.,He finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.,For days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.,Malachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.,In the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.,I try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.,When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.,She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.,I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.,I'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam,says,,They get their appetites because they're starving half the time.,When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,,It had to be and the reason is this,Could it be true, someone like you,Could love me, love me?,When Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.,When Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is,say a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.,When Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.,All seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.,Come and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.,But Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,,From neither of them shall I part.,For one is my mother,,God bless her and love her,,The other is my sweetheart.,Malachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.,When we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.,When Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?,Malachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors?,Mam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.,He comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland.,Deep in Canadian woods we met,From one bright island flown.,Great is the land we tread, but yet,Our hearts are with our own.,Up, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up.,Mam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph,,isn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she,I want them up, he says. I want them,be free from the center to the sea.,Don't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house.,a penny in your pocket without,says.,ready for the day Ireland will,do it'll be a sorry day in,He pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do?,Mam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed.,On the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.,Mam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?,He puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling.

devta,Paisa bolta: mulya kitna,Aaj terko kharid leta,Ho kalakaar ya abnetri ya neta,Ye sab screen ke andar alag dikhta,Bahar jhakha duniya...,Bahar duniya jhaka dikha ke,Boht hi log saans lera,Maane bohot hi log,Pehle kuch log saans lena karo bandh,Bohot hi log ki duniya jaake jagah dhundh,Ye shaurat wali nai chakachaundh,Ye door se alag dikhta matlab galat dikhta,Ye mandbuddhi baccha kon?,Abbe collar se pehchaan,Abbe shaurat hai apan shaurat,Ruab bole,Abbe paisa bhi toh ruab,Wo khali na bole,Par tu toh hi bolta,Paisa bolta,Ha toh paisa bolta: tera mulya kitna,Aaj terko kharid leta,Mmm ruk ja,Devalue karta, kharid ta, phir terko bech deta,Oye sun thoda ijjat se baat kar,Shaurat bolta ye izzat mai kamai hai,Paisa bolta kamai hai to kabhi bechega na,Ye koi jod tod ki cheej toh hai nai,Na roj roj ke breathing, eating mai koi kami,Shaurat bole:,The thing yall do for money,Man its precautionary,Chalti shraddha ki currency pe economy,Apni tabhi baat ban gayi,Aur baaki jo naseeb,Paisa bolta: not so easily,Don't cash in the winnings,Paisa bolta: mulya kitna?,Puchta shaurat se khulam khula,Ke bata shuruat se mulya kiska zyada,Wo bole: apan ijjj,Apna day one se,Wo kya bolte community building wala scene,Paisa bolta: saale tum log 10 log ke beech,Khud ko prasthapit svayam ghoshit king,We don't count that shit in,Mangggg,Can you deposit it in a bank,Shaurat bolta: i would,But it's too costly for you,If i cash in the winnings,Oh yea please don't cash out your share,Keep it moving,Oh yea, yes, samaj ke be,It's understood,Yes,Ye game ko jitna diya,Usse zyada usne liya,That's true,Stuck in the middle wit you,Kamakal ye na samjhe kyu,Apne ek hi cheej ke do pehlu,Jab bhi amiri mai dhool chipi,Aavashyakta puchu,Ek ke hone se dusre ke aana avashya hai kyu?,Ham wo kaaran jis se mite usool,Kinda works out for you,Shuarat bolta: saath mil ja mere,Ek baare mere monday morning office mil ke ja tu,Let's work together,I got plans for you,Takeover whats new,Aaj ka jamaana new age kids,Shits just too fkn easy,Remember apan ek hi sikke ke do pehlu,Jarur,Paisa bole: sikka?,Hahahahaegggg,Come on dawg,Apka pura framework mere pe sanchaalit tha,Aap wo system mai jo tel malish tha,Machine ko chikna rakhe,Cheezein maze mai lage,Pachas mai kaam khalas,Apka offer very generous,Par merko malum ke ek na ek din ye tu puchega jarur,Par yahi toh problem tha shaurat ka shuruat se,Uska value mostly tha chamak mai,Aur chamak ka toh kya,Insaan chutiya toh chakma de,And that's a market force, that's not a market,Smart face,Paisa bolta: mai jeet gya,Mai tabhi jeet gya,Jab paisa asli duniya mai asli ka cheej tha,Aur shuarat nai,The thing we'll do for money,You might also like,,,2 number,Ha, ruab ruab and allat,But that shit catch up to you,When u live a life that's not designed to be lived,But looked,Real important,Apno ka dekha war,Tell em facts, baby tell em facts,Apno ka dekha war,Saalo saal leke chala tune diya tha jo ghaav,Apno ka dekha waar,Aaj boht hu akela,Fir bhi ji nahi chalta ke kar du tujhe maaf,Apno ka dekha waar,Banda haraamjada,Abbe sun rha hai tu bsdk,Banda haraamjaada,Merko mat mil aur jaan ne ki jyada koshish bhi na kar,Merko jaanke ascharya se badhkar niraasha aavak,Maansik sthiti hilti merko thodo so hosh bhi na ab,Kisko kya boldu bc merko wo sikha mat,Mere karrebi mai jooth dikhte, dikhaati,Mai ek kalpanik duniya ka malik,Merko upar neeche mai antar nai dikhta ab,Aur uske beech saari cheej lage jhaali,Tabhi chadhti aur tarakki ke naam pe din chadte,Aur meri rooh neeche aur neeche dhasti chalti jaa rhi,Rishte padte bhari, lagti mehnat,Merko jutha lagta pyaar,Apno ka dekha waar,Trust issues make me make this move har bar,Apno ka dekha waar,Launde boht hai legit,Par launde chahte ke cheen le jeet, bane haar,Dekha war,Abbe tu aur tere sage,Mere Lund pe baje aaj,Raate baje baara tyare tara ghare poche vaat,Abbe mai jeet rha hu,Abbe mai jeet rha hu,Tu mere liye thoda sa khush hona,Mera baap uska aadha jindgi wantedi kaati,Aur wo story bhi aadhi,Baapu jail mai mai school mai,Thaanedaar har mangalwar ghar ke baar,Apno ka dekha waar,Thane ke dwar ke uss paar,Jab haath ay toh todd daale taang,Tabhi jab bhi ye,Har baat baat pe gang gang shit karte,Merko samaj nai padte,But i understand the reaction,Ye tera street tha, ye sab mera ghar pe,Glorifying nai re,System ko dekhe che jeeye,Jabhi police ki badli tabhi badle aaropi,Judges ke benches, kitne open cases,Kabhi haal na puche, kitne phone pe trace the,Wo sab jail ke visit, ghar rakhte girve,Ya bank maarti seale phir waij aake cheen le,Wo legal ... par uska matlab nai ke wo chori nai hai,Kuch cheeje mujhko kehni nai hai,Par kuch cheeje tumko sunn ni chahiye,San do hajaar 6,Pappa teesri chauthi baar andar,Mummy contemplate suicide attempt,Man i wasn't even 10,Wo daur alag khauf alag,Aane mai daer ho gai,Darr lage pr aawaz nai kar,Dekha dekhi mai log kya kar jaate,Apni abru saanvre,Ek vruksh samaan hai,Roots deeply grounded,Toh hal jhad se jaanche,Mera famly tree been about it,Kaise bolu samaaj bola merko ye khottta admi,Rap music bola merko yeiich jindagani,Bc naak ke upar paani,Toda sab cheej ka daam,Yaha im stackin bail money,Asal,Pichle, 2-3 saal se baatcheet bahdri,Catastrophically,Maine markasheet chohdi,Jab police aake mere baap ki chargesheet bhar di,Mai jidhar se udhar hum log ne kya ni kar di,Haan ruab ruab,Pan la enni bocchi jhali bag mai daal,Mera bhootkaal andhkaar,Mai ganda fookta,Merko dhoondhta dhanda,Tum log jagah dhoondhta,Mera pata pooch,Saalo saal leke chala tune diya tha jo ghaav,Apno ka dekha waar,Mudafuka dont kno how this gujju gang shit run deep for me,2 number,Akad mai jeevan,Aur tu mar jayega toh bhi na puche haal,Aisi naazuk si sthiti,Par dimaag hi aisa karta kaamEmbed --> Text

      "Error translating text: Je me souviens !,Mais comme j'ai la mémoire courte,Bah j'ai déjà oublié, du coup j'en ai rien à foutre !,Barman, tu rajouteras l'incident diplomatique à mon ardoise,Parce que je me torche le cul avec l'amitié franco-québécoise,Moi c'est quand ça sent le gaz que j'aime jouer avec le feu,Je suis docteur et kamikaze, t'es un comique qui suce des queues,Et je suis venu te prescrire une cure de suppositoires,Dès demain, pendant un mois, un doigt dans le cul matin et soir,C'est tout ce que tu m'inspire toi qui ne fais rien de tes mains,T'es pas un kriss de chômeur, t'es un crosseur de grand chemin,Et t'aurais pas autant de courage si y'avait pas autant de témoins,Connard ! Moi j'ai la rage car on me compare à un gamin,J'ai une affaire à faire tourner, j'ai des salaires à payer,Et ce trou du cul n'est pas foutu de trouver les tunes pour son loyer ?,Ostie, où est passé ton sens de la débrouille ?,Et ne me dis pas que tu l'as perdu en même temps que ta paire de couilles, petit,Oui, j'envie ton insouciance, mais pas tes références de merde,Oui tu manies les mots, mais certainement pas le verbe,Oublie les jeux vidéos, élève ta verve, tes idéaux,Et tu sauras à quoi ressemble ce monde vu d'en haut,T'es trop terre-à-terre, (mais) je suis pas là pour ton pénis,Mais pour m'imprégner du parfum des fleurs de lys,Et me promener sous le soleil, au beau jardin du temps qui court,Mon cher Freddy, c'est à ton tour,De te laisser parler d'amour,You might also like,Wojtek, t'es une fucking bitch,Tu veux l'odeur des fleurs de lys ?,Au Québec y'a pas de fleurs de lys,Vieux flip de merde, écris moi de meilleurs flips Crack,Broke Forever mixtape, sérieusement, brûlez du weed là-dessus,Fais peu importe ce que tu feel là-dessus,Drogue ta fille là-dessus, viole ta tante en ton fils là-dessus,Ta mère, clair que je la fist là-dessus,Tellement fort, je suis comme Goku contre Cell quand mon fils la tue,Pis là tu jackass comme Steve-O,T'es pas de mon niveau,En clash, je suis evil,J'ai bien trop de combos pour smash ce nigaud,Punch, slap, doigts dans les yeux; roche papier ciseaux,Le RC t'as donné plein de shine, t'es idiot,Quand tu craches dessus comme une sale petite ho,Tu veux jouer les démons comme Al Pacino,Mais t'es juste un ingrat, Dan DeVito,Va te faire foutre pas douze huges dudes boursoufflés,En passant, ta petit copine, elle a quatre trous pour jouer,Elle a son vag, son cul, sa bouche et le petit trou pour souffler,Aw, je comprends pourquoi t'appelles ta poule poupée,Dans ton battle contre Kard, t'as laissé toute la foule époustouflée,Parce qu'en plein clash t'as sorti une banane pour bouffer,Mais moi je suis le plus broke des rappeurs Queb, et ça je vais vous le prouver,Si il sort une banane contre moi, bah je la garde pour souper,Broke, Nigga ! Broke !,Fait que tu me fais vraiment pas peur,Nan, je te blague, j'ai vraiment peur quand je check ton visage,Sérieusement Wojtek, c'est l'enfer, être aussi pâle,Est-ce que je t'amène à la morgue ou est-ce que je t'emmène à l'hôpital ?,Sérieux, tu ressembles à un spectre de grand-père avec le cancer du sida,Sérieusement, what the fuck is this ?,T'as dit que j'ai perdu mes couilles pis que je suce trop ?,What the fuck, t'es une fucking bitch !,Parce que la preuve que c'est toi qui suce trop:,Dude tu t'es habillé en Montréal-Québec comme un ostie d'opportuniste,Fuck out of here !,Round 2,,,C'est pas un foutu déguisement,C'est juste que le mois d'aout à Montréal c'est un fou dépaysement,Opportuniste et touriste hein... pas mal,Mais ma plume est de celles qui arrachent cœurs et papiers,La tienne est une pucelle qui vient me chatouiller les pieds,Tu veux me ridiculiser ? Admire l'ironie du sort,Le ridicule me tue pas, ce qui me tue pas me rend plus fort,J'assume mes contradictions, ma prose est objective,Et je n'écris ta destruction qu'avec des critiques constructives,Alors c'est peut-être qu'une impression mais en ce moment je me dis souvent,Que Freddy Gruesum c'était crissement mieux avant,T'es l'esclave d'internet, t'es tombé dans le panneau,Tu parles moins d'amour que de starlettes du porno,Mais si pour toi Paris Hilton est une égérie du hip hop,Je suis désolé de dire que pour moi c'est qu'une belle salope !,Au nom du beau, du sacré, et de la magie j'imagine,Moi j'en ai marre de parler de plottes, glottes et angines,Alors compare pas mon désir à tes pauvres pulsions lubriques,Toi t'as misé sur le plaisir et sur l'industrie du ludique,Résultat: tu promotionnes l'alcool et la drogue,Mais pour moi ça revient à pousser les jeunes à la morgue,Alors je t'en supplie, je t'en prie même,Reprend tes esprits, redresse-toi et bombe le torse,Essaye de résister au côté obscure de la Force,Amicalement, je te reproche d'avoir sous-estimé,Ton talent, ton approche et ce pourquoi t'es destiné,Car à ce jour une chose est sûre, et c'est pour moi la plus grotesque,-C'est- que malgré ton nom de famille tu n'aies rien de chevaleresque,,Fait que dans tes vieux clashs, t'as des propos plus racistes qu'un redneck texan,Peut-être, mais tu me fais pas peur avec tes textes sans têtes,T'es pas le best,Je sais pas pourquoi Wojtek s'entête,J'ai des textes en tête qui vont laisser Wojtek sans tête,Yes !,Je suis le best avec mes phases,Je suis le plus cool des loosers, après les Habs,Toi t'es juste un looser, arrête le rap,T'es super poche; Vicky Beckham avec une cape,Sale taré, ostie de taspé, calice d'enfoiré, hippopotame châtré !,Où est ta mère ? I need love,Cool J nigga,Elle est mûre ? Je passe à travers,Kool Aid nigga,J'ai ces propos trop osés qui font bobos aux oreilles,Mes vers valent trop cher, qu'est ce que je vais faire de toute cette oseille ?,M'acheter un grosse épée, avec un long long long blade,Je te mack le corps au complet, comme Swagg Man, là t'es po-po-po-po-posey,Ta ho je vais la violer, après je vais en parler comme Rosey,T'es po-po-po-po-posey,En ce moment je peux freestyle, nan je suis pas en train de choker,C'est Freddy Grues, fuck toi, suck mon nez !,No doubt,,Round 3,,,Quand Fili m'a proposé de m'héberger dans tes narines,J'ai refusé car je voulais pas être roulé dans la farine,Il m'a proposé ton cul... Je voulais pas faire d'histoire,Mais j'avais peur d'être à l'étroit entre Dony et Crack-a-Starr,C'est drôle hein ? Mais c'est navrant de facilité,Je préfère viser utile, tu mises sur des futilités,Tu as des bonnes capacités,Mais ta créativité manque de bon sens, d'intelligence et surtout d'agressivité,Alors au lieu de te rassurer derrière des fresques cartoonesques,Arrête de te persuader que le rap c'est tout ce qu'il te reste,Car y'a trop de trucs à faire, genre visiter le monde,Ou rendre ta mère fière en te trouvant une kriss de blonde,Car si le ciel t'a envoyé telle une brebis parmi les loups,Bah je crois pas que ça soit pour faire des feats avec Babylou,Les battles c'est que de l'amour, moi au nom de l'Eternel,Je suis venu t'offrir une belle gifle paternelle,Et comme je suis pas un ingrat, avant que je bouge,Je voulais t'offrir ma Wojtape et une bonne bouteille de vin rouge,(Et fuck la douane américaine au passage),Profites-en pour méditer et pour affûter ton éloquence,Moi je vous fais la promesse de profiter de mes vacances,Et sur ce je me casse, parce que ce battle je m'en tabarnak,Et si quelqu'un me cherche, bah je serais au café Cléopâtre,,,Tu prétend pouvoir tuer tous les MC's d'ici ?,Nigger please, t'as diss les WordUp! ?,Ca fait deux ans que tu liches Fili pour venir ici,Yo...,Ca fait trois ans que tu liches Fili pour venir ici !,Pour qu'il accepte t'as du lui promettre au moins dix-mille trees pour qu'il dise oui,Pis ton cachet c'est un little-bitty-mini-piece de petit biscuit,Fucking cookie !,C'est vrai que j'ai des lignes de vieux pervers,Gigidi Gigigidi !,Toi si tu gagnes tous tes battles c'est parce que Pauline est sur ton petit zizi,De ouistiti,Mais t'es rien qu'une petite bitch,Tu t'achètes des bikinis au KGG,T'es une très petite bitch,T'es genre le Mini-Me de Mini-Me,Petite bitch,Mais il paraît que t'es une bête en battle,Aight, ok,Lui une bête en bateau ? Harsh, no way !,Pétasse, je te ramène au pied du piédestal,Pas de voiture, mais quand je te kick dans gueule, j'ai le pied sur la pédale,It's Gruesum time !,Je rentre chez toi,Bla bla bla bla bla... Je fais plein d'affaires,Je viole ton père avec la graine de ta mère,Ta grand-maman, j'aime ses mammaires,Quand je laisse sa schnek remplie de sang c'est des règles de grand-mère,Fait que va te faire mettre par ton maître à la messe, devant tout le monde,Yeah,Je vais te réduire en pièces, tu mess avec un monstre,Yeah,Je me branle à deux mains sur internet devant ta mom, en checkant des photos de ta nièce parce que j'aime trop ses tétons,Yeaaah..,Mais c'est même pas le genre de poule que je veux,Mais elle est comme Ryu dans Street Fighter, elle a des boules de feu,Mais fuck ta bitch, fuck la bitch, de toute façon ici la bitch,C'est toi ma puce,Yo Freddy Gruesum, Broke Forever mixtape,Bitch, c'est toi ma pub,Anyways, t'es fucking hideux,Fait que juste pour ça, je viens chez toi,Et je te beat down avec le shit de Justin BieberEmbed --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) ascend to Heaven,,Tum Ek Gorakh Dhanda Ho,You are one tricky business,,Aap Hi Apna Parda Ho,You are your own veil,,Tum Ek Gorakh Dhandha Ho,,Jo Kehta Hoon Maana, Tumhein Lagta Hai Bura Sa,I accept that what I am going to say, you might not like a little bit,,Phir Bhi Hai Mujhe Tum Se Baharhaal Gila Sa,But still, I have a complaint to make,,Chup Chaap Rahe Dekthe Tum Arsh-e-bareen Par,You sat quietly on your throne while watching,,Tapte Huay Karbal Mein Muhammad Ka Nawasa,While Muhammad’s grandson was in the scorching desert of Karbala,,Khud Teen Dinon Se Wo Agarche Tha Piyasa,Though he was thirsty for three days,,Kis Tarhe Pilata Tha Lahoo Apna Wafa Ko,How he was giving blood for his loyalists,,Dushman To Bahar Taur Thay Dushman Magar, Afsos,His

      "Error translating text: And What Befel Them of Things Seld-Seen and Peregrine.,,The King asked her, \"And what was their story?\" and she answered: It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was in the City of Safety, Baghdad, before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marwán, a King, Omar bin al-Nu'umán highs, who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the Chosroës of Persia and the Kaysars of Eastern Rome; for none could warm himself at his fire; nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray; and, when he was angered, there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame. He had made himself King over all quarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sind and Sin, the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains of Al-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China. Moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and Diyár Bakr, or Mesopotamia, and over Sudán, the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, Sayhún and Jayhún, Nile and Euphrates. He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler of the Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan, who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself. This Prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old, and Allah subjected His servants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess in battle. Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legally married, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save Sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. For he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year; and on this wise he abode for a length of time. Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. Presently, by decree of the Decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim, the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, \"Haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!\" Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. But when the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, \"Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:\" so quoth he to himself, \"If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:\" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. Such was the case with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by name Sofiyah or Sophia, whom the King of Roum and Lord of Cæsarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, \"O King! I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing\"—a speech which much pleased the King. During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool. Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. In due time Sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. So they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carried the news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. But, after the two had departed, quoth Sophia to the midwives, \"Wait with me awhile, for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb.\" Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy. The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al-Makán and his sister Nuzhat al-Zamán. They answered \"Hearing and obedience,\" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. Moreover the people of Baghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of his son, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. After this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. And when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. One day, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, \"O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord of Constantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest.\" He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. They kissed the ground before him and said, \"O King glorious and strong! O lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afrídún, Lord of Ionia land and of the Nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander, whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail. When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of the Arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King, Afridun. The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. When our King heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,—whereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway. So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and of Khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance.\" Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Forty-sixth Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. When the King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his Wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. Herewith rose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan highs, who kissed the ground before Omar and said, \"O King, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. Moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money.\" The King pleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, \"Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle.\" Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do. Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-à-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, \"Ye have delay of three days.\" They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. When the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city; and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money. Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, \"I hear and I obey;\" and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. After this, the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. So the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady. As for Sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country. So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets which was dense with growth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, Eastern and Western. He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" But as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, \"Now by the crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle!\" He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,,,\"Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters,            course through plain and wood:,No work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all,            gifts, Giver of all good!\",,And as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon. Through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,,,\"The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens,            debonnair:,Double its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-,           fair:,Virgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to,            ensnare;,And like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of,            their hair:,Shooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond,          compare;,Overpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire.\",Sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and temple locks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essence and attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,,,\"She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * And her,            straight slender stature enshamed the lance:,She burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * Where all manner of,            beauties have habitance:,And the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * Whence,            issues a dawn tide of happiest chance.\",,Then Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, \"Come ye on, that I may wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and the dawn break!\" So each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and the beldam said as in wrath, \"O strumpet, cost thou glory in grounding these girls? Behold I am an old woman, yet have I thrown them forty times! So what hast thou to boast of? But if thou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels!\" The young lady smiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, and she jumped up and asked, \"O my lady Zat al-Dawahi, by the truth of the Messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, or dost thou jest with me?\"; and she answered, \"Yea,\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Forty-seventh Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the young lady asked Zat al-Dawahi, \"By the truth of the Messiah, wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?\", and she answered, \"Yea, I will wrestle with thee in very deed\" (Sharrkan looking on the while), the damsel cried, \"Rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do.\" When the old woman heard this, she raged with exceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog. Then she sprang to her feet, whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, \"Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked, Mistress whore!\" So she loosed her petticoat trousers and, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body; then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or a spotted snake. With this she inclined towards the damsel and said, \"Do thou as I have done.\" All this time, Sharrkan was gazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance. So the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash of Yamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples, as it were a bed of Nu'uman's anemones; and breasts like double pomegranates. Then the old woman leant towards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while Sharrkan raised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle might beat the beldam. Presently the young woman get beneath the old woman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground with both; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in so doing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine; furthermore she let fly two great farts one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of Heaven. Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground. Then he arose and, baring his brand looked right and left, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back, and said to himself, \"He lied not who named thee Lady of Calamities! Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others.\" So he drew near them to hear what should pass between them. Then the young lady went up to the old one and, throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying, \"O my lady Zat al- Dawahi, I intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thou triedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to Allah for safety!\" She returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned, with the fair damsel standing amongst them. Quoth Sharrkan to himself, \"Every luck hath its cause. Sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me.\" So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandished shouting the while his war cry, \"Allah is All mighty!\" When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firm stand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, the normal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the farther side, where she turned and cried out with a loud voice, \"Who art thou, O thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? Whence camest thou and whither art thou going? Speak sooth, for truth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies come of villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, did we shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue four thousand knights. So tell me what thou wantest; and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will do so.\" When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, \"I am a stranger of the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them.\" Quoth she, \"I would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, by Allah, they shall never be thy spoil. Have I not told thee that to lie is villein vile?\" Quoth he, \"The wise man is he who taketh warning by others.\" Thereupon quoth she, \"By the truth of the Messiah, did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands, I would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might, but I take pity upon the stranger. So, if thou seek booty, I require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, I and thou. If thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty; but if I throw thee, thou shalt become under my command. Swear this to me, for I fear thy treachery: indeed it hath become a common saw, 'Where Perfidy is innate there Trust is a weakly mate.' Now an thou wilt swear I will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee.\" Answered Sharrkan (and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul, \"Truly she knoweth not that I am a champion of champions\"); \"Swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and I will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest, 'Draw near that I wrestle with thee.' If thou throw me, I have money where withal to ransom myself; and if I throw thee, 'twill be booty and booty enough for me!\" Rejoined the damsel, \"I am content herewith!\" and Sharrkan was astounded at her words and said, \"And by the truth of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and keep!) I too am content on the other part!\" Then said she, \"Swear to me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of Al- Islam.\" Sharrkan replied, \"By Allah! were a Kazi to swear me, even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis, he would not impose upon me such an oath as this!\" Then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in the sea of thought, saying in himself, \"Praise be to Him who fashioned her from dirty water!\" Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling, and said to her, \"Cross the stream to me;\" but she replied, \"It is not for me to come over to thee: if thou wilt, pass thou over here to me.\" \"I cannot do that,\" quoth he, and quoth she, \"O boy, I will come across to thee.\" So she tucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side of the stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms. But he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the Hand of Power had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann, which had been fostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. Then she called out to him, \"O Moslem, come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning,\" and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with its whiteness; and Sharrkan was dazzled by it. Then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like, and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms. Presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the roaring gale. So she lifted him up and, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lost mastery over his senses. Then she asked him, \"O Moslem! the slaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself?\"; and he answered, \"O my lady, thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; for our prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) prohibited the slaying of women and children, old men and monks!\" \"As it was thus revealed to your Prophet,\" she replied, \"it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy; so rise. I give thee thy life, for generosity is never lost upon the generous.\" Then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; and she said to him, \"Be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth the land of Roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist Kings against Kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?\" \"'Twas not for lack of strength in me,\" he answered; \"nor didst thou throw me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so if thou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy.\" She laughed and said, \"I grant thee thy request: but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, and it were only right I should loose them, for haply this next wrestling bout will be long.\" Then she went to the slave girls and, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of Greece, \"Get ye to some safe place, till I foil this Moslem's lust and longing for you.\" So they went away, whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two. Then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when he felt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxing ware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground. He fell on his back, and then she said to him, \"Rise: I give thee thy life a second time. I spared thee in the first count because of thy Prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women; and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but I charge thee, if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al-Nu'uman to succour the King of Constantinople, a stronger than thou, send him hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shifts and trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thigh Lite, the jostle and the leg-lock.\" \"By Allah, O my lady,\" quoth Sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed against her), \"had I been Master al-Safdí, Master Mohammed Kimál or Ibn al-Saddí, as they were in their prime, I had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest; for O my mistress, by Allah, thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by the blandishments of thy back parts; for we men of Mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight. But now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me, and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three: moreover I have regained my presence of mind.\" When she heard his words she said to him, \"Hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling, O vanquished one? However come on, an thou wilt; but know that this must be the last round.\" Then she bent forward and challenged him and Sharrkan did lik --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

      "Error translating text: There lived once in the city of Cufa a man called Al-Rabí'a bin Hátim, who was one of the chief men of the town, a wealthy and a healthy, and Heaven had vouchsafed him a son, whom he named Ni'amah Allah. One day, being in the slave-brokers' mart, he saw a woman exposed for sale with a little maid of wonderful beauty and grace on her arm. So he beckoned to the broker and asked him, \"How much for this woman and her daughter?\" He answered \"Fifty dinars.\" Quoth Al-Rabi'a \"Write the contract of sale and take the money and give it to her owner.\" Then he gave the broker the price and his brokerage and taking the woman and her child, carried them to his house. Now when the daughter of his uncle who was his wife saw the slave, she said to her husband, \"O my cousin, what is this damsel?\" He replied, \"Of a truth, I bought her for the sake of the little one on her arm; for know that, when she groweth up, there will not be her like for beauty, either in the land of the Arabs or the Ajams.\" His wife remarked, \"Right was thy rede\", and said to the woman \"What is thy name?\" She replied, \"O my lady, my name is Tauflík.\" \"And what is thy daughter's name?\" asked she? Answered the slave, \"Sa'ad, the happy.\" Rejoined her mistress; \"Thou sayst sooth, thou art indeed happy, and happy is he who hath bought thee.\" Then quoth she to her husband, \"O my cousin, what wilt thou call her?\"; and quoth he, \"Whatso thou chooses\"; so she said, \"Then let us call her Naomi,\" and he rejoined \"Good is thy device.\" The little Naomi was reared with Al-Rabi'a's son Ni'amah in one cradle, so to speak, till the twain reached the age of ten and each grew handsomer than the other; and the boy used to address her, \"O my sister!\" and she, \"O my brother!\", till they came to that age when Al-Rabi'a said to Ni'amah, \"O my son, Naomi is not thy sister but thy slave. I bought her in thy name whilst thou wast yet in the cradle; so call her no more sister from this day forth.\" Quoth Ni'amah, \"If that be so, I will take her to wife.\" Then he went to his mother and told her of this, and she said to him, \"O my son, she is thy handmaid.\" So he wedded and went in unto Naomi and loved her; and two years passed over them whilst in this condition, nor was there in all Cufa a fairer girl than Naomi, or a sweeter or a more graceful. As she grew up she learnt the Koran and read works of science and excelled in music and playing upon all kinds of instruments; and in the beauty of her singing she surpassed all the folk of her time. Now one day as she sat with her husband in the wine chamber, she took the lute, tightened the strings, and sang these two couplets,,,\"While thou'rt my lord whose bounty's my estate, * A sword,             whereby my woes to annihilate,,Recourse I never need to Amru or Zayd, * Nor aught save,             thee if way to me grow strait!\",,Ni'amah was charmed with these verses and said to her, \"By my life, O Naomi, sing to us with the tambourine and other instruments!\" So she sang these couplets to a lively measure,,\"By His life who holds my guiding rein, I swear * I'll meet on,             love ground parlous foe nor care:,Good sooth I'll vex revilers, thee obey * And quit my slumbers,             and all joy forswear:,And for thy love I'll dig in vitals mine * A grave, nor shall my,             vitals weet 'tis there!\",,And Ni'amah exclaimed, \"Heaven favoured art thou, O Naomi!\" But whilst they led thus the most joyous life, behold! Al-Hajjáj, the Viceroy of Cufa said to himself, \"Needs must I contrive to take this girl named Naomi and send her to the Commander of the Faithful, Abd al-Malik bin Marwán, for he hath not in his palace her like for beauty and sweet singing.\" So he summoned an old woman of the duennas of his wives and said to her, \"Go to the house of Al-Rabi'a and foregather with the girl Naomi and combine means to carry her off; for her like is not to be found on the face of the earth.\" She promised to do his bidding; the next morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devotee and hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand; and, henting in hand a staff and a leather water bottle of Yamani manufacture.— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-eighth Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman promised to do the bidding of Al-Hajjaj, and whenas it was morning she donned the woollen clothes of a devotee and hung around her neck a rosary of beads by the thousand and hent in hand a staff and a leather water bottle of Yamani manufacture and fared forth crying, \"Glory be to Allah! Praised be Allah! There is no god but the God! Allah is Most Great! There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" Nor did she leave off her lauds and her groaning in prayer whilst her heart was full of guile and wiles, till she came to the house of Ni'amah bin al-Rabi'a at the hour of noon prayer, and knocked at the door. The doorkeeper opened and said to her, \"What dost thou want?\" Quoth she, \"I am a poor pious woman, whom the time of noon prayer hath overtaken, and fief would I pray in this blessed place.\" Answered the porter, \"O old woman, this is no mosque nor oratory, but the house of Ni'amah son of al Rabi'a.\" She replied, \"I know there is neither cathedral-mosque nor oratory like the house of Ni'amah bin al-Rabi'a. I am a chamberwoman of the palace of the Prince of True Believers and am come out for worship and the visitation of Holy Places.\" But the porter rejoined, \"Thou canst not enter;\" and many words passed between them, till at last she caught hold and hung to him saying, \"Shall the like of me be denied admission to the house of Ni'amah bin al-Rabi'a, I who have free access to the houses of Emirs and Grandees?\" Anon, out came Ni'amah and, hearing their loud language, laughed and bade the old woman enter after him. So she followed him into the presence of Naomi, whom she saluted after the godliest and goodliest fashion, and, when she looked on her, she was confounded at her exceeding seemliness and said to her, \"O my lady, I commend thee to the safeguard of Allah, who made thee and thy lord fellows in beauty and loveliness!\" Then she stood up in the prayer niche and betook herself to inclination and prostration and prayer, till day departed and night darkened and starkened, when Naomi said to her, \"O my mother, rest thy legs and feet awhile.\" Replied the old woman \"O my lady, whoso seeketh the world to come let him weary him in this world, and whoso wearieth not himself in this world shall not attain the dwellings of the just in the world to come.\" Then Naomi brought her food and said to her, \"Eat of my bread and pray Heaven to accept my penitence and to have mercy on me.\" But she cried, \"O my lady, I am fasting. As for thee, thou art but a girl and it befitteth thee to eat and drink and make merry; Allah be indulgent to thee!; for the Almighty saith: All shall be punished except him who shall repent and believe and shall work a righteous work.\" So Naomi continued sitting with the old woman in talk and presently said to Ni'amah, \"O my lord, conjure this ancient dame to sojourn with us awhile, for piety and devotion are imprinted on her countenance.\" Quoth he, \"Set apart for her a chamber where she may say her prayers; and suffer no one to go in to her: peradventure, Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) shall prosper us by the blessing of her presence and never separate us.\" So the old woman passed her night in praying and reciting the Koran; and when Allah caused the morn to dawn, she went in to Ni'amah and Naomi and, giving them good morning, said to them, \"I pray Allah have you in His holy keeping!\" Quoth Naomi, \"Whither away, O my mother? My lord hath bidden me set apart for thee a chamber, where thou mayst seclude thee for thy devotions.\" Replied the old woman, \"Allah give him long life, and continue His favour to you both! But I would have you charge the doorkeeper not to stay my coming in to you; and, Inshallah! I will go the round of the Holy Places and pray for you two at the end of my devotions every day and night.\" Then she went out (whilst Naomi wept for parting with her knowing not the cause of her coming), and returned to Al-Hajjaj who said to her, \"As thou do my bidding soon, thou shalt have of me abundant good.\" Quoth she, \"I ask of thee a full month;\" and quoth he \"Take the month.\" Thereupon the old hag fell to daily visiting Ni'amah's house and frequented his slave-wife, Naomi.— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-ninth Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old hag fell to visiting daily Ni'amah's house and frequenting his slave wife, Naomi; and both ceased not to honour her, and she used to go in to them morning and evening and all in the house respected her till, one day, being alone with Naomi, she said to her, \"O my lady! by Allah, when I go to the Holy Places, I will pray for thee; and I only wish thou wert with me, that thou mightest look on the Elders of the Faith who resort thither, and they should pray for thee, according to thy desire.\" Naomi cried, \"I conjure thee by Allah take me with thee!\"; and she replied, \"Ask leave of thy mother in law, and I will take thee.\" So Naomi said to her husband's mother, \"O my lady, ask my master to let us go forth, me and thee, one day with this my old mother, to prayer and worship with the Fakirs in the Holy Places.\" Now when Ni'amah came in and sat down, the old woman went up to him and would have kissed his hand, but he forbade her; so she invoked blessings on him and left the house. Next day she came again, in the absence of Ni'amah, and she addressed Naomi, saying, \"We prayed for thee yesterday; but arise now and divert thyself and return ere thy lord come home.\" So Naomi said to her mother-in-law, \"I beseech thee, for Allah's sake, give me leave to go with this pious woman, that I may sight the saints of Allah in the Holy Places, and return speedily ere my lord come back.\" Quoth Ni'amah's mother, \"I fear lest thy lord know;\" but said the old woman, \"By Allah, I will not let her take seat on the floor; no, she shall look, standing on her feet, and not tarry.\" So she took the damsel by guile and, carrying her to Al-Hajjaj's palace, told him of her coming, after placing her in a lonely chamber; whereupon he went in to her and, looking upon her, saw her to be the loveliest of the people of the day, never had he beheld her like. Now when Naomi caught sight of him she veiled her face from him; but he left her not till he had called his Chamberlain, whom he commanded to take fifty horsemen; and he bade him mount the damsel on a swift dromedary, and bear her to Damascus and there deliver her to the Commander of the Faithful, Abd al-Malik bin Marwan. Moreover, he gave him a letter for the Caliph, saying, \"Bear him this letter and bring me his answer and hasten thy return to me.\" So the Chamberlain, without losing time, took the damsel (and she tearful for separation from her lord) and, setting out with her on a dromedary, gave not over journeying till he reached Damascus. There he sought audience of the Commander of the Faithful and, when it was granted, the Chamberlain delivered the damsel and reported the circumstance. The Caliph appointed her a separate apartment and going into his Harim, said to his wife, \"Al Hajjaj hath bought me a slave-girl of the daughters of the Kings of Cufa for ten thousand dinars, and hath sent me this letter.\"— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,When it was the Two Hundred and Fortieth Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Caliph acquainted his wife with the story of the slave-girl, she said to him, \"Allah increase to thee His favour!\" Then the Caliph's sister went in to the supposed slave-girl and, when she saw her, she said, \"By Allah, not unlucky is the man who hath thee in his house, were thy cost an hundred thousand dinars!\" And Naomi replied, \"O fair of face, what King's palace is this, and what is the city?\" She answered, \"This is the city of Damascus, and this is the palace of my brother, the Commander of the Faithful, Abd al-Malik bin Marwan.\" Then she resumed, \"Didst thou not know all this?\" Naomi said, \"By Allah, O my lady, I had no knowledge of it!\"; when the other asked, \"And he who sold thee and took thy price did he not tell thee that the Caliph had bought thee?\" Now when Naomi heard these words, she shed tears and said to herself, \"Verily, I have been tricked and the trick hath succeeded,\" adding to herself, \"If I speak, none will credit me; so I will hold my peace and take patience, for I know that the relief of Allah is near.\" Then she bent her head for shame, and indeed her cheeks were tanned by the journey and the sun. So the Caliph's sister left her that day and returned to her on the morrow with clothes and necklaces of jewels, and dressed her; after which the Caliph came in to her and sat down by her side, and his sister said to him, \"Look on this handmaid in whom Allah hath conjoined every perfection of beauty and loveliness.\" So he said to Naomi, \"Draw back the veil from thy face;\" but she would not unveil, and he beheld not her face. However, he saw her wrists and love of her entered his heart; and he said to his sister, \"I will not go in unto her for three days, till she be cheered by thy converse.\" Then he arose and left her, but Naomi ceased not to brood over her case and sigh for her separation from her master, Ni'amah, till she fell sick of a fever during the night and ate not nor drank; and her favour faded and her charms were changed. They told the Caliph of this and her condition grieved him; so he visited her with physicians and men of skill, but none could come at a cure for her. This is how it fared with her; but as regards Ni'amah, when he returned home he sat down on his bed and cried, \"Ho, Naomi!\" But she answered not; so he rose in haste and called out, yet none came to him, as all the women in the house had hidden themselves for fear of him. Then he went out to his mother, whom he found sitting with her cheek on her hand, and said to her, \"O my mother, where is Naomi?\" She answered, \"O my son, she is with one who is worthier than I to be trusted with her, namely, the devout old woman; she went forth with her to visit devotionally the Fakirs and return.\" Quoth Ni'amah, \"Since when hath this been her habit and at what hour went she forth?\" Quoth his mother, \"She went out early in the morning.\" He asked, \"And how camest thou to give her leave for this?\"; and she answered, \"O my son, 'twas she persuaded me.\" \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" exclaimed Ni'amah and, going forth from his home in a state of distraction, he repaired to the Captain of the Watch to whom said he, \"Doss thou play tricks upon me and steal-my slave-girl away from my house? I will assuredly complain of thee to the Commander of the Faithful.\" Said the Chief of Police, \"Who hath taken her?\" and Ni'amah replied, \"An old woman of such and such a mien, clad in woollen raiment and carrying a rosary of beads numbered by thousands.\" Rejoined the other, \"Find me the old woman and I will get thee back thy slave-girl.\" \"And who knows the old woman?\" retorted Ni'amah. \"And who knows the hidden things save Allah (may He be extolled and exalted!)?\" cried the Chief, who knew her for Al-Hajjaj's procuress. Cried Ni'amah, \"I look to thee for my slave-girl, and Al-Hajjaj shall judge between thee and me;\" and the Master of Police answered, \"Go to whom thou wilt.\" So Ni'amah went to the palace of Al-Hajjaj, for his father was one of the chief men of Cufa; and, when he arrived there, the Chamberlain went in to the Governor and told him the case; whereupon Al-Hajjaj said, \"Hither with him!\" and when he stood before him enquired, \"What be thy business?\" Said Ni'amah, \"Such and such things have befallen me;\" and the Governor said, \"Bring me the Chief of Police, and we will commend him to seek for the old woman.\" Now he knew that the Chief of Police was acquainted with her; so, when he came, he said to him, \"I wish thee to make search for the slave-girl of Ni'amah son of Al-Rabi'a.\" And he answered, \"None knoweth the hidden things save Almighty Allah.\" Rejoined Al-Hajjaj, \"There is no help for it but thou send out horsemen and look for the damsel in all the roads, and seek for her in the towns.\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Two Hundred and Forty-First Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Al-Hajjaj said to the Captain of the Watch, \"There is no help for it but thou send out horsemen, and look for the damsel on all the roads and seek for her in the towns.\" Then he turned to Ni'amah and said to him, \"And thy slave-girl return not, I will give thee ten slave-girls from my house and ten from that of the Chief of Police.\" And he again bade the Captain of the Watch, \"Go and seek for the girl.\" So he went out, and Ni'amah returned home full of trouble and despairing of life; for he had now reached the age of fourteen and there was yet no hair on his side cheeks. So he wept and lamented and shut himself up from his household; and ceased not to weep and lament, he and his mother, till the morning, when his father came in to him and said, \"O my son, of a truth, Al-Hajjaj hath put a cheat upon the damsel and hath taken her; but from hour to hour Allah giveth relief.\" However grief redoubled on Ni'amah, so that he knew not what he said nor knew he who came in to him, and he fell sick for three months his charms were changed, his father despaired of him and the physicians visited him and said, \"There is no remedy for him save the damsel.\" Now as his father was sitting one day, behold he heard tell of a skillful Persian physician, whom the folk gave out for perfect in medicine and astrology and geomancy. So Al-Rabi'a sent for him and, seating him by his side, entreated him with honour and said to him, \"Look into my son's case.\" Thereupon quoth he to Ni'amah, \"Give me thy hand.\" The young man gave him his hand and he felt his pulse and his joints and looked in his face; then he laughed and, turning to his father, said, \"Thy son's sole ailment is one of the heart.\" He replied, Thou sayest sooth, O sage, but apply thy skill to his state and case, and acquaint me with the whole thereof and hide naught from me of his condition.\" Quoth the Persian, \"Of a truth he is enamoured of a slave-girl and this slave-girl is either in Bassorah or Damascus; and there is no remedy for him but reunion with her.\" Said Al-Rabi'a, \"An thou bring them together, thou shalt live all thy life in wealth and delight.\" Answered the Persian, \"In good sooth this be an easy matter and soon brought about,\" and he turned to Ni'amah and said to him, \"No hurt shall befall thee; so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear.\" Then quoth he to Al-Rabi'a, \"Bring me out four thousand dinars of your money;\" so he gave them to him, and he added, \"I wish to carry thy son with me to Damascus; and Almighty Allah willing, I will not return thence but with the damsel.\" Then he turned to the youth and asked, \"What is thy name?\"; and he answered \"Ni'amah.\" Quoth the Persian, \"O Ni'amah, sit up and be of good heart, for Allah will reunite thee with the damsel.\" And when he sat up the leach continued, \"Be of good cheer for we set out for Damascus this very day: put thy trust in the Lord and eat and drink and be cheerful so as to fortify thyself for travel.\" Upon this the Persian began making preparation of all things needed, such as presents and rarities; and he took of Al-Rabi'a in all the sum of ten thousand dinars, together with horses and camels and beasts of burden and other requisites. Then Ni'amah farewelled his father and mother and journeyed with the physician to Aleppo. They could find no news of Naomi there so they fared on to Damascus, where they abode three days, after which the Persian took a shop and he adorned even the shelves with vessels of costly porcelain, with covers of silver, and with gildings and stuffs of price. Moreover, he set before himself vases and flagons of glass full of all manner of ointments and ups, and he surrounded them with cups of crystal—and, placing astrolabe and geomantic tablet facing him, he donned a physician's habit and took his seat in the shop. Then he set Ni'amah standing before him clad in a shirt and gown of silk and, girding his middle with a silken kerchief gold-embroidered, said to him, \"O Ni'amah, henceforth thou art my son; so call me naught but sire, and I will call thee naught but son.\" And he replied, \"I hear and I obey.\" Thereupon the people of Damascus flocked to the Persian's shop that they might gaze on the youth's goodliness and the beauty of the shop and its contents, whilst the physician spoke to Ni'amah in Persian and he answered him in the same tongue, for he knew the language, after the wont of the sons of the notables. So that Persian doctor soon became known among the townsfolk and they began to acquaint him with their ailments, and he to prescribe for them remedies. Moreover, they brought him the water of the sick in phials, and he would test it and say, \"He, whose water this is, is suffering from such and such a disease,\" and the patient would declare, \"Verily this physician sayeth sooth.\" So he continued to do the occasions of the folk and they to flock to him, till his fame spread throughout the city and into the houses of the great. Now, one day as he sat in his-shop, behold, there came up an old woman riding on an ass with a stuffed saddle of brocade embroidered with jewels; and, stopping before the Persian's shop, drew rein and beckoned him, saying, \"Take my hand.\" He took her hand, and she alighted and asked him \"Art thou the Persian physician from Irak?\" \"Yes,\" answered he, and she said, \"Know that I have a sick daughter.\" Then she brought out to him a phial—and the Persian looked at it and said to her, \"O my mistress, tell me thy daughter's name, that I may calculate her horoscope and learn the hour in which it will befit her to drink medicine.\" She replied, \"O my brother the Persian, her name is Naomi.\"— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Two Hundred and Forty-second Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Persian heard the name of Naomi, he fell to calculating and writing on his hand and presently said, \"O my lady, I cannot prescribe a medicine for her till I know what country woman she is, because of the difference of climate: so tell me in what land she was brought up and what is her age.\" The old woman replied \"She is fourteen years old and she was brought up in Cufa of Irak.\" He asked, \"And how long hath she sojourned in this country?\" \"But a few months,\" answered she. Now when Ni'amah heard the old woman's words and recognised the name of his slave- girl, his heart fluttered and he was like to faint. Then said the Persian, \"Such and such medicines will suit her case;\" and the old woman rejoined, \"Then make them up and give me what thou hast mentioned, with the blessing of Almighty Allah.\" So saying, she threw upon the shop board ten gold pieces, and he looked at Ni'amah and bade him prepare the necessary drugs; whereupon she also looked at the youth and exclaimed, \"Allah have thee in his keeping, O my son! Verily, she favoureth thee in age and mien.\" Then said she to the physician, \"O my brother the Persian, is this thy slave or thy son?\" \"He is my son,\" answered he. So Ni'amah put up the medicine and, placing it in a little box, took a piece of paper and wrote thereon these two couplets,,,\"If Naomi bless me with a single glance, * Let Su'adá sue and,             Juml joy to,They said, \"Forget her: twenty such thou'lt find.\" * But none is,             like her—I will not forget!\",,He pressed the paper into the box and, sealing it up, wrote upon the cover the following words in Cufic characters, \"I am Ni'amah of al-Rabi'a of Cufa.\" Then he set it before the old woman who took it and bade them farewell and returned to the Caliph's palace, and when she went up with the drugs to the damsel she placed the little box of medicine at her feet, saying, \"O my lady, know that there is lately come to our town a Persian physician, than whom I never saw a more skilful nor a better versed in matters of malady. I told him thy name, after showing him the water-bottle, and forthwith he knew thine ailment and prescribed a remedy. Then he bade his son make thee up this medicine; and there is not in Damascus a comelier or a seemlier youth than this lad of his, nor hath anyone a shop the like of his shop.\" So Naomi took the box and, seeing the names of her lord and his father written on the cover, changed colour and said to herself, \"Doubtless, the owner of this shop is come in search of me.\" So she said to the old woman, \"Describe to me this youth.\" Answered the old woman, \"His name is Ni'amah, he hath a mole on his right eyebrow, is richly clad and is perfectly handsome.\" Cried Naomi, \"Give me the medicine, whereon be the blessing and help of Almighty Allah!\" So she drank off the potion (and she laughing) and said, \"Indeed, it is a blessed medicine!\" Then she sought in the box and, finding the paper, opened it, read it, understood it and knew that this was indeed her lord, whereas her heart was solaced and she rejoiced. Now when the old woman saw her laughing, she exclaimed, \"This is indeed a blessed day!\"; and Naomi said, \"O nurse, I have a mind for something to eat and drink.\" The old woman said to the serving women, \"Bring a tray of dainty viands for your mistress;\" whereupon they set food before her and she sat down to eat. And behold in came the Caliph who, seeing her sitting at meat, rejoiced; and the old woman said to him, \"O Commander of the Faithful, I give thee joy of thy hand maid Naomi's recovery! And the cause is that there is lately come to this our city a physician than whom I never saw a better versed in diseases and their remedies. I fetched her medicine from him and she hath drunken of it but once and is restored to health.\" Quoth he, \"Take a thousand dinars and apply thyself to her treatment, till she be completely recovered.\" And he went away, rejoicing in the damsel's recovery, whilst the old woman betook herself to the Persian's house and delivered the thousand dinars, giving him to know that she was become the Caliph's slave and also handing him a letter which Naomi had written. He took it and gave the letter to Ni'amah, who at first sight knew her hand and fell down in a swoon. When he revived he opened the letter and found these words written therein: \"From the slave despoiled of her Ni'amah, her delight; her whose reason hath been beguiled and who is parted from the core of her heart. But afterwards of a truth thy letter hath reached me and hath broadened my breast, and solaced my soul, even as saith the poet,,,\"Thy note came: long lost hungers wrote that note, * Till drop,             they sweetest scents for what they wrote:,Twas Moses to his mother's arms restored; * 'Twas Jacob's eye-,             sight cured by Joseph's coat!\",,When Ni'amah read these verses, his eyes ran over with tears and the old woman said to him, \"What maketh thee to weep, O my son? Allah never cause thine eye to shed tears!\" Cried the Persian, \"O my lady, how should my son not weep, seeing that this is his slave-girl and he her lord, Ni'amah son of al-Rabi'a of Cufa; and her health dependeth on her seeing him, for naught aileth her but loving him.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,When it was the Two Hundred and Forty-third Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian cried out to the old woman, \"How shall my son not weep, seeing that this is his slave-girl and he her lord, Ni'amah son of al-Rabi'a of Cufa; and the health of this damsel dependeth on her seeing him and naught aileth her but loving him. So, do thou, O my lady, take these thousand dinars to thyself and thou shalt have of me yet more than this; only look on us with eyes of rush; for we know not how to bring this affair to a happy end save through thee.\" Then she said to Ni'amah, \"Say, art thou indeed her lord?\" He replied, \"Yes,\" and she rejoined, \"Thou sayest sooth; for she ceaseth not continually to name thee.\" Then he told her all that had passed from first to last, and she said, \"O youth, thou shalt owe thy reunion with her to none but myself.\" So she mounted and, at once returning to Naomi, looked in her face and laughed saying, \"It is just, O my daughter, that thou weep and fall sick for thy separation from thy master, Ni'amah, son of Al-Rabi'a of Cufa.\" Quoth Naomi, \"Verily, the veil hath been withdrawn for thee and the truth revealed to thee.\" Rejoined the old woman, \"Be of good cheer and take heart, for I will assuredly bring you together, though it cost me my life.\" Then she returned to Ni'amah and said to him, \"I went to thy slave- girl and conversed with her, and I find that she longeth for thee yet more than thou for her; for although the Commander of the Faithful is minded to become intimate with her, she refuseth herself to him. But if thou be stout of purpose and firm of heart, I will bring you together and venture my life for you, and play some trick and make shift to carry thee into the Caliph's palace, where thou shalt meet her, for she cannot come forth.\" And Ni'amah answered, \"Allah requite thee with good!\" Then she took leave of him and went back to Naomi and said, \"Thy lord is indeed dying of love for thee and would fain see thee and foregather with thee. What sayest thou?\" Naomi replied, \"And I too am longing for his sight and dying for his love.\" Whereupon the old woman took a parcel of women's clothes and ornaments and, repairing to Ni'amah, said to him, \"Come with me into some place apart.\" So he brought her into the room behind the shop where she stained his hands and decked his wrists and plaited his hair, after which she clad him in a slave-girl's habit and adorned him after the fairest fashion of woman's adornment, till he was as one of the Houris of the Garden of Heaven, and when she saw him thus she exclaimed, \"Blessed be Allah, best of Creators! By Allah, thou art handsomer than the damsel. Now, walk with thy left shoulder forwards and thy right well behind, and sway thy hips from side to side.\" So he walked before her, as she bade him; and, when she saw he had caught the trick of woman's gait, she said to him, \"Expect me tomorrow night, and Allah willing, I will take and carry thee to the palace. But when thou seest the Chamberlains and the Eunuchs be bold, and bow thy head and speak not with any, for I will prevent their speech; and with Allah is success!\" Accordingly, when the morning dawned, she returned and, carrying him to the palace, entered before him and he after her step by step. The Chamberlain would have stopped his entering, but the old woman said to him, \"O most ill omened of slaves, this is the handmaid of Naomi, the Caliph's favourite. How durst thou stay her when she would enter?\" Then said she, \"Come in, O damsel!\"; and the old woman went in and they ceased not faring on, till they drew near the door leading to the inner piazza of the palace, when she said to him, \"O Ni'amah, hearten thyself and take courage and enter and turn to the left: then count five doors and pass through the sixth, for it is that of the place prepared for thee. Fear nothing, and if any speak to thee, answer not, neither stop.\" Then she went up with him to the door, and the Chamberlain there on guard accosted her, saying \"What damsel is this?\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,,When it was the Two Hundred and Forty-fourth Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Chamberlain accosted the old woman, saying, \"What damsel is this?\"; quoth the ancient dame, \"Our lady hath a mind to buy her;\" and he rejoined, \"None may enter save by leave of the Commander of the Faithful; so do thou go back with her. I can not let her pass for thus am I commanded.\" Replied the old woman, \"O Chief Chamberlain, use thy reason. Thou knowest that Naomi, the Caliph's slave-girl, of whom he is enamoured, is but now restored to health and the Commander of the Faithful hardly yet crediteth her recovery. She is minded to buy this ha --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

I’m still asking him the basics, still thinking, I dunno, that he’ll remember something or maybe he’ll just get so frustrated with me that he’ll crack.,I still want to know what you were doing that afternoon.

Like it’s just--,,Sarah Koenig,I mean, do I have an ending? Um...,Of course I have an ending. We’re going to come to an ending today. Plus, a smattering of new information, a review of old information cast under a different light and an ending. In case you haven’t noticed, my thoughts about Adnan’s case, about who is lying and why, have not been fixed over the course of this story. Several times, I have landed on a decision, I’ve made up my mind and stayed there, with relief and then inevitably, I learn something I didn’t know before and I’m up ended. Sometimes the reversal takes a few weeks, sometimes it happens within hours. And what’s been astonishing to me is how the back and forth hasn’t let up, after all of this time. Even into this very week and I kid you not, into this very day that I’m writing this. Because I’m learning new information all the time.,For instance, I talked to Don. Eight months ago he told me he did not want to talk to me for this story and then last week he talked to me for this story. He didn’t want me to use tape of his voice or his last name but he said I could use what he said. Spoiler here: Don does not appear to know what happened to Hae, or why it happened to her, or whether Adnan is guilty. But it was interesting to hear what he said he remembered about the day Hae disappeared and about her and about the trial. Here’s what he told me. Don said Hae was at his house in a town north of Baltimore City on the night of January 12, the night before she went missing. He said she wanted to spend the whole next day with him too. She wanted him to call Woodlawn High School and pretend to be some authority figure, tell the office Hae couldn’t be in school that day. She wanted it to be an excused absence rather than just plain hooky. But he didn’t. He says he thought she should go to school and besides, he told her he had to work the next day at 9am. It was supposed to be his day off from the LensCrafters at the Owings Mills Mall where they both worked, but Don said he arranged to fill in for a friend at the store in Hunt Valley. Don said he and Hae had made plans to meet up later that night of the 13th after her work shift ended at 10 p.m. When the cops recovered Hae’s car there was a note inside with Don’s name on it. “Hey cutie, sorry I couldn’t stay. I have to go to a wrestling match at Randelstown High, but I promise to page you as soon as I get home, ok? Till then, take care and drive safely. Always, Hae.” In a P.S. on the note, Hae mentions a tv interview that had been taped that day. The local station had done a student athlete segment on her. So the note was written on the 13th, the day she went missing. This note was one of the reasons I’d initially written to Don, way back when. “Sorry I couldn’t stay,” is confusing. I didn’t understand what she’d planned to do with the note, put it on his car maybe, but his car was so far away in Hunt Valley. But the note stumped Don too. He said he didn’t know about it until I sent it to him and he didn’t have a guess as to what her plan was for that afternoon. When Hae went missing, Don was one of the first people the cops called. He says he knew immediately he’d be a suspect. He said, “that was the first thought when they said she’s missing. I said, ‘well ok, they’re going to try to blame it on me because she was with me last night. I’m the new boyfriend, I’m obviously going to be one of the first suspects, me and Adnan.’” He said he immediately made sure he knew where he was. “When someone calls you up and tells you ‘have you seen this person? They went missing, they haven’t been seen since school,’ you automatically retrace everything you did that day. Did I see them, did I hear from them, did they page me, did they call me, where was I at this time, what was I doing at that time, yeah.”,Maybe you’re all noting, as I did, that that wasn’t Adnan’s stated reaction to getting called by the cops on the 13th. I’m tempted to make a judgment right here, but I’m going to pull a benefit of the doubt because Adnan was seventeen, he was stoned, he’s a different person, but noted, right? Also note however, there was one similarity in how they reacted to Hae’s disappearance. You know how Adnan says he doesn’t remember calling Hae after the 13th? Guess who else doesn’t remember trying to call Hae after the 13th - Don. Like everyone else, he said he wondered whether maybe she’d gone to California, she’d told him her father lived there. He says it’s not that he didn’t think about what had happened or didn’t worry, it’s just that he didn’t know what to do. Don’s alibi was solid. His computer generated time card said he’d arrived at work at 9:02 a.m. on the 13th, taken lunch from 1:10 to 1:42, clocked out at 6 p.m. But Don’s manager at the Hunt Valley store was his Mom, so that didn’t look great. Don said he was anxious throughout the investigation.,“They never, up until the day they arrested Adnan, I had no idea what was going on” he said. “They never said you’re cleared as a suspect. It was left hanging and until they arrested him I had no idea. I suspected they might try to say we were in on it together. I didn’t know Jay existed until I started listening to the podcast.”,Don had met Adnan once. According to Hae’s diary it was December 23. It was a snowy day and she had a minor car accident on the way into work and she’d called Adnan to come help her out. They were broken up by this time but he came to the rescue. In the parking lot outside LensCrafters, Adnan and Don converged. Hae writes, “Don and Adnan took a look at my car and told me not to drive it unanimously. Ah! Mommy is going to be so mad. But I swear it’s not my fault.”,Don told the cops back then that he and Adnan had a perfectly nice conversation. At trial he said Adnan said something to him like “ok, well, I just want to make sure you’re an ok guy.” Don told me the same. “We sat and talked and just as everyone else described him, he was very polite, articulate, just really the typical what you’d expect of the ex-boyfriend meeting the new boyfriend, sizing each other up. We joked, we spent a good 10-15 minutes talking after we checked out the car.” At trial, for whatever reason, this episode is firmly timestamped as having happened in January, after Hae and Don had started dating, though it’s clear from the diary it was December 23rd. In any case, Don’s testimony at both trials, he’s the State’s witness, is milquetoast. He just says, “yeah, I met him, it was cordial.” Which made me wonder why the State even called Don and according to Don, prosecutor Kevin Urick might have been wondering the same thing. Don said, “when I testified, they pulled me in a back room and let me tell you how fun that was, to have the prosecutor afterwards yelling at me because I did not make Adnan sound creepy,” he said, “they wanted me to make him sound creepy. So creepy that I felt intimidated, which I did not. Adnan, he was very personable. He was funny, he was everything I already said. He was somebody that I would have hung out with if I knew him in school.” Don’s memory is that Urick yelled at him after both the first and second trials. “Oh, he was irate” Don said, “when I say yelling, he was literally yelling about it at me.” I ran this by Kevin Urick but he said he was not authorised to talk about the case.,Don says he loved Hae, that he still loves her. It’s not something that goes away he said. Even though they only officially dated for thirteen days, he says she meant a lot to him. She was totally unshy he said, confident. She pursued him, he said, for all of December whenever she saw him at work, he said she’d ask him when he was going to take her out. Constantly she asked him, followed him into the lunch room on his break, pestered him. He was dating someone else at the time but then that ended and so on New Year’s Eve they made their first date for the next day. He fell for her pretty quickly he says. “You could not not like this girl. She was aggressive, intelligent, assertive is a better word than aggressive. Generally nice person. Anything I’ve heard anybody say about her since, it’s not like ‘oh I don’t want to talk bad about the dead,’ it’s just being honest. It’s hard for me to explain. If you didn’t like her, you didn’t like her because she was so likeable. But then you couldn’t even be annoyed by her because she wasn’t annoying. She was charming.”,Don said Hae actually changed him, changed the way he thought about himself. He said he’d come off a couple of bad relationships, girls who had cheated on him. “She basically in no uncertain terms told me to knock it off,” he said, “that I’m worth, that I have worth. I don’t remember the words she used. I can’t paraphrase it at this point but I am worth having self esteem, that I should think that I am good enough, and I took it to heart, especially after I found out that she had died.”,Josh,I’m sorry that I’m throwing it so late in the game here, but I didn’t even know that this existed until Friday.,,Sarah Koenig,Yeah, that ok, no that’s ok, that’s ok.,Here’s another guy I just heard from, and speaking of him, all of a sudden I was hearing Jay’s perspective. Or at least this guy’s perspective of Jay’s perspective.,,Josh,He was scared. I mean, like terrified.,Sarah Koenig,This guy’s name is Josh. He asked that I not use his last name. He said he worked with Jay at South West Video, the porn store. Josh was twenty-one at the time. They weren’t close friends he said, but Josh would give Jay rides and they’d smoke weed together, hang out a little bit. Josh said that on the night that Jay was first picked up by the cops, so late at night on February 27 and into the morning of the 28, Jay called him at home and asked him to come into the store because he didn’t want to be alone there. He was that scared.,Josh,He was, I mean, frightened out of his mind and not of the police. They were the secondary fear. I mean, he was afraid of going to jail, but not like he was afraid of-- Adman, I guess is how you say his name, I don’t know.,,Sarah Koenig,Adnan?,,Josh,Adnan, that’s it.,,Sarah Koenig,Josh says Jay actually never told him Adnan’s name, but Josh has listened to the podcast so he knows the name now. But back then, he didn’t. He says Jay told him he was afraid that people were after him. People connected to the murderer.,Josh,Across the street from the video store was a parking lot for the Amtrak commuter trains. And the parking lot was usually empty in the evening. Well, that particular night there was a van in that parking lot, which I’m pretty positive had nobody in it, but Jay was afraid. I mean, to the point-- he was almost in tears.,Sarah Koenig,Yeah.,,Josh,He didn’t want to go outside, he didn’t even want to look out the door because he really thought the van that was across the street was people waiting to get him.,,Sarah Koenig,But the people you’re talking about, is it only in retrospect that you’re thinking it’s Adnan’s people, or did he say that to you at the time?,,Josh,Oh no, he said it. He said it was-- I guess Adnan, had threatened him.,Sarah Koenig,Right, but you’re saying that you didn’t know, he never told you the name of the person. I’m just trying to imagine is it possible that it was somebody else entirely who he was afraid of.,,Josh,Yeah, I guess it could have been but whoever he was afraid of is obviously the person that committed the crime.,,Sarah Koenig,Right, but so I’m saying did you-- did he express to you at the time that this was a person with Pakistani relatives--,,Josh,Yeah.,,Sarah Koenig,Oh, he did, he said that at the time?,,Josh,Yeah, he definitely said it was somebody, the guy was Middle Eastern.,Sarah Koenig,Josh says Jay told him it was the ex-boyfriend who’d killed Hae. It was Josh’s impression that Jay had called the cops himself that night, because he told Josh the cops were coming to get him, and he seemed anxious that it was taking them so long to get there. Josh says Jay was pacing, checking his watch, that he kept asking him to look outside to see if the van was still there. At trial, Jay testifies that the cops showed up at the video store on their own, that he didn’t know they were coming. In his taped interview with the police that same night, February 28, Jay doesn’t mention a white van, or that he’s terrified of Adnan’s people. But he does tell the cops that he’s talked to Adnan either yesterday or the day before and that Adnan was threatening him in a general way. Here’s tape from that February 28 interview. Detective Ritz talks first.,,Detective Ritz,When was the last conversation you had with Adnan?,,Jay,I think it was either yesterday or the day before.,,Detective Ritz,The most recent conversation you had with him, what was the content of that conversation?,,Jay,I learned that you guys were looking for me.,Detective Ritz,How did you learn that?,,Jay,People told me. Friends of mine told me you guys were coming to question me. So I went to him and said, “what did you get me wrapped up in?” and he just told me, “just calm down, everything will be ok.”,Detective Ritz,Where did this conversation take place?,,Jay,I believe it was in front of my house in (inaudible) Park.,,Detective Ritz,Other than you saying, “what the fuck did you do? Why did you get me wrapped up in this?” what did he say?,,Jay,He just told me, “ain’t nothing that happened. They don’t know shit,” and “stay cool.”,,Detective Ritz,Is there anything else said during that conversation?,,Jay,(pause) He told me that he knew somebody. (pause) I used to be involved in a lot of illegal activity and people on the West Side-- basically the gist of what he told me was that he knew the West Side hitman. So I wouldn’t call it a threat, but he was letting me know.,Detective Ritz,--in a roundabout way that if you said something to the police that--,,Jay,Yeah, because I told him, if they come to me I ain’t going to fuck around, I’m just going to tell them what the gig is, and he was like, “you know who I know.” That’s what he said to me.,,Sarah Koenig,OK, so the West Side Hitman? It’s so strange, I find Josh’s version of Jay’s fear so much more believable than Jay’s version of Jay’s fear. Which makes me wonder if it’s all just in the delivery. When Jay first told Josh weeks before that he knew something about the missing girl who was all over the news, Josh says he didn’t believe him.,Josh,I said something about him not really being involved and then he’s like, “no man, you don’t understand, I helped to bury the body.” It seemed like he was kind of bragging, I mean that’s kind of the guy that Jay was. It’s not that he bragged about stuff that he did, sometimes he made up things that he didn’t do and so that’s kind of what I thought he was doing. Why would you say that, why would you tell somebody that you really don’t know that well-- and I guess it’s why I didn’t believe him. If I had done it, I certainly wouldn’t have told me.,,Sarah Koenig,Right.,,Josh,Maybe my best friend or something like that, but not not somebody that you work with at a porn store.,,Sarah Koenig,The version of the crime that Josh says Jay eventually told him, it’s pretty close to the version that Jay’s friend Chris told me too. That Jay was out somewhere and that Adnan came to him and showed him the body and said something to the effect of “you gotta help me.” Josh says he can’t remember where Jay said he was when this happened, but he is certain the words “Best Buy” were never attached to the story. Josh went to that Best Buy all the time and he says he definitely would have remembered that. He said when he heard in the podcast that Chris had mentioned the pool hall thing, that sounded right to him but he can’t say for sure. Josh says he also had the impression, like Chris, that it had all gone down later in the day, not mid afternoon. Josh says at first, Jay seemed afraid the cops were going to figure out he was involved through fingerprints or DNA or something, but that as time went on he seemed more and more afraid of the guy who did it, that he was threatening Stephanie. It was, “you’d better keep your mouth shut or else.” He says Jay told him the threats were getting more forceful. To Josh, Jay was so not the type to be involved in a murder. Maybe he tried to act tough he said, but he wasn’t. He said he himself had friends who got in serious fights or who’d been locked up for grand theft auto, but Jay was not in that category at all he said. He was a nice guy.,Josh,He wasn’t the type of guy that you really got the sense he could do something real. He wasn’t a killer and he wasn’t a thug. If anything, he was kind of the opposite. He seemed like he was in way over his head.,Sarah Koenig,Yeah.,,Josh,I remember feeling bad for him.,,Sarah Koenig,Was there any point-- I mean I don’t mean to sound judgy or something, but was there any point where you’re like “well, you should go tell the cops then, if you know who did this. Go tell the cops.”,Josh,No, not really. I know that’s probably what I should have said but I didn’t really believe him and like I said, when it comes to reputation, on the street you don’t want to be the guy that’s “oh, go snitch.” You don’t want anybody to see you’re weak and all that stuff and so I didn’t ever say go to the cops because that would be like the bitch thing to do.,Sarah Koenig,Josh says what never quite made sense to him, what he never entirely understood was why Jay would help Adnan bury Hae.,,Josh,Even if I didn’t call the cops, I definitely wouldn’t grab a shovel and help him dig a grave.,,Sarah Koenig,Right, I know. I know, I know. That’s what’s hard about the story is that you just figure there’s something that’s not computing here.,,Josh,It definitely never sounded right which is why I never believed him until the cops actually picked him up.,,Sarah Koenig,Josh says he only remembers seeing Jay one more time after that, he thinks maybe Jay came by the store to pick up his check and when Josh asked him, “so what happened?” Josh says Jay told him he couldn’t talk about it.,In preparation for this episode, Julie and Dana, the producers of this show, went back over everything we had. All the police files, the attorney files, the interviews I’ve done, the cell records. They did one final sweep just to be sure we’d weighed everything and because old details can have startling new meaning after a year’s worth of research is behind us. They came across a couple of things they wanted me to know.,First and foremost, the Nisha call. I’d asked them, “is there any other viable explanation for the Nisha call on Adnan’s cell record?” Here’s Julie.,,Julie Snyder,We’d always been under the impression that the Nisha call was a no-way-around-it call.,Sarah Koenig,It looks terrible for him.,,Julie Snyder,It looks terrible for him and it’s 2 minutes and 22 seconds.,Sarah Koenig,To remind you, the Nisha call is the one that happens at 3:32pm on January 13. It’s to that girl that Adnan has been flirting with who lived near Silver Spring. The Nisha call is the one that’s always stuck out to me and I think to most people who’ve looked at Adnan’s case closely because it happens on the afternoon that Hae disappeared at a time when Adnan has said, insisted even, that he was not with his phone, that Jay had his phone while he was in school. Jay had told the detectives that Adnan had called some girl in Silver Spring that afternoon and briefly put Jay on the phone with her. That’s why the call is so important. Not only does it put Adnan together with his phone in the middle of the afternoon, it puts Adnan together with Jay in the middle of the afternoon. It corroborates Jay’s story. I’ve always had some suspicion about this call because Nisha said to the cops and at trial that there was a day when Adnan put his friend Jay on the phone, but Nisha has consistently said it happened toward the evening at the video store where they worked. Jay didn’t have the video store job on January 13. He started that job at the end of the month. So I never bought the idea that the thirteenth was the day she talked to Jay. But even so, it didn’t look good for Adnan because who was calling Nisha in the middle of the afternoon then? Jay didn’t know Nisha. So for me this call has remained one of the pillars of the case against Adnan. That’s what Julie means when she says “no way around it.” But now, I think the Nisha call might be moving from the “no way around it, this looks bad for Adnan’ column” into “eh, now I’m not so sure.” Adnan says that Nisha’s number was programmed into his cellphone, so he’s always said to me, “maybe the button got pushed accidentally, like a butt dial and then the answering machine picked up.” The problem with that explanation besides how convenient it sounds for Adnan is that there was not answering machine on that line. That’s what Nisha says at trial. This call shows up not just on the call log but on Adnan’s AT&T bill. He got charged for it. So this was our quest, or really Dana and Julie’s quest: to find out, is it possible that this call would have shown up on Adnan’s bill even if it went unanswered. This proved so elusive, first we got one answer, then another, then another, then another. AT&T was not helping us, then finally, Dana and Julie figured out exactly what they needed to answer this question. An AT&T customer service agreement circa 1999. They found one, in a class action lawsuit against AT&T that included as an exhibit, the very document we needed.,,Julie Snyder,Luckily that class action lawsuit was filed in New York so Dana was able to go down to the--,,Sarah Koenig,That’s the photo you sent.,,Dana Chivvis,That’s the Old Records Department of the New York Supreme Court or something like that, yeah.,,Sarah Koenig,That’s so awesome. It looked like the Mad Hatters archive room. Were you the first humanoid who’d come down in like fifteen years? (laughing),,Dana Chivvis,Yeah, they were like, “what news do you bring?”,,Julie Snyder,So Dana goes down there, pulls the service agreement, takes pictures of the contract, sends the first picture, the first picture says on the contract, it says “we do not bill for unanswered calls.”,,Sarah Koenig,Oh!,Meaning the Nisha had to have been answered because it shows up on the bill. But there was fine print to the fine print. When Dana flipped through to the last page of the contract she found a loophole. The loophole says AT&T won’t charge for unanswered calls unless the call isn’t terminated within a “reasonable time.” So if you call someone and it rings and rings and you don’t hang up within a “reasonable time,” AT&T will charge you for that call even if it’s unanswered. So what is a reasonable amount of time, or rather, an unreasonable amount of time? That loophole actually still exists today and the unreasonable amount of time today is thirty seconds or longer, they’ll charge. We saw one contract from ‘99 that specified sixty seconds or longer, so it stands to reason that two minutes were probably covered. They probably did charge. The folks at AT&T told us the only reason a contract would have varied back then in ‘99 was if the State had passed particular legislation to address it. We didn’t find anything in the Maryland rules about it, so after all this work we feel pretty confident that AT&T would have charged for a call that rang and rang for more than two minutes in Maryland in 1999.,So either way if it’s two minutes and twenty-two seconds it’s probably unreasonable.,,Julie Snyder,It’s probably unreasonable.,,Dana Chivvis,That seems unreasonable,,Sarah Koenig,It an unreasonable amount of time to be listening to a phone ring, I gotta say, without it being answered so (laughs)--,,Julie Snyder,It’s an unreasonable amount of work going in trying to figure this out. (laughs),,Sarah Koenig,I know that’s a long and perhaps way too detailed way of explaining it but all this adds up to something important. It means the Nisha call could conceivably have been a butt dial that no one answered. It means there isn’t only one explanation for the Nisha call. There are alternative scenarios. It could be that Adnan called Nisha, or it could be that Jay was with somebody else who called Nisha, or maybe Jay or someone else called Nisha by accident. A butt dial and no one was ever the wiser because no one ever picked up. If there are alternative scenarios, then that means the list of things we know, actually definitively know, facts we can show about the evidence against Adnan, that list just got shorter.,In a way the only hard evidence in the case against Adnan is his cellphone record for January 13. That’s what the cops and prosecutor used to corroborate Jay’s statements. So Dana and Julie looked at that same record all over again, the call log and the cell tower map, teased it all apart, to see if they could figure out what happened. To figure out if there was anything else I could know about what Jay and Adnan were doing that day. We’ve talked about the call log a lot already, we already knew it didn’t match Jay’s explanations of where they went and when. But when Julie looked again, she realized, when she tried to assign the calls some semblance of a narrative, her picture of the day crumbled even more. Instead of answering any of her questions, the call log raised bigger ones, such as was everyone lying about that day?,My original question going into this whole endeavour, this whole story was either Jay’s lying or Adnan’s lying. But what if it’s not either or, what if it’s both and? The call log evidence is screwy right from the beginning. Jay said that when he met up that morning, when Adnan drove over to Jay’s to give him his car, they’d gone shopping at the mall. Adnan has said various things, but not that they went shopping. What seems most likely according to what Adnan told his attorney at the time is that Adnan hung out with Jay until about 12:45-1:00 p.m. and then went back to school. There’s a 12:07 call and a 12:41 call. The first pings a tower out west in Ellicott City. The next pings a tower back east toward Baltimore City. They’re pretty far apart from each other. Here’s Julie.,,Julie Snyder,Going to Ellicott City, and then going into Baltimore City, where the phone is pinging off of Edmonson Avenue area, which is actually near drug strips where Hae’s car was dumped. That sort of area of Baltimore. That’s not mentioned by Adnan. So, “I don’t remember what we did. I know we didn’t go shopping. I’m not really sure.” I feel more concerned and suspicious-- I feel suspicious, of being like, “huh,” because I can see being-- I can see where the phone was moving. I know Jay’s story about Security Square Mall is not true because of the phone, if they had the phone. But I don’t think Adnan’s is true either.,,Dana Chivvis,Can I also add that at one point, Jenn says to the detective that she remembers one of those phone calls she answered and talked to Jay and Jay had said that he was downtown with Adnan.,,Sarah Koenig,The prosecutor at trial said, “we don’t really know what they were doing, but it doesn’t matter, because Hae was in school at that time. Alive.” That’s true. But still the phone record tells us that there’s something they’re not telling us. Why, and is it related to what happened later. The next call is the incoming 2:36 call. The supposed “Best Buy” call from the phone booth that we’re pretty solidly convinced wasn’t the “come and get me” call.,I do have something of an update there. We have not found evidence of a phone booth outside the Best Buy on the sidewalk, like Jay draws on his map for the cops. But we have now seen two anecdotal reports that there was a payphone inside the vestibule. We haven’t been able to verify these reports, but we did get a look at the 1994 architectural plans for that Best Buy, and indeed on the plans there is a teeny little rectangle in the vestibule on the left as you walk in, labeled “payphone.” So, maybe there was one. Inside.,Anyway, back to the call log. Julie spent a long time thinking about the 3:21 call. It opened a whole new mystery for her, because it’s confusing on about three different levels. It’s an outgoing call, from Adnan’s cell to Jenn’s house phone. Jay and Jenn both talk about some call that afternoon that comes into her landline. Someone supposedly looking for Jay.,,Julie Snyder,Jenn says she remembers Jay getting phone calls while he was at her house. Jay says he remembers getting phone calls while at the house. Both of them also reference a landline call. Jay says, “I get a call on the landline, and that’s when I leave.”,,Sarah Koenig,Meaning, right? This incoming landline call is Adnan calling in looking for Jay.,,Julie Snyder,Why would Adnan be calling you on the landline? The whole point of him giving you the cell phone was so that he could call you on the cell phone. It doesn’t make any sense. But there is a 3:21 call made from the cell phone to Jenn’s house.,Sarah Koenig,Here’s the second confusing thing. Jay eventually told the cops the 3:21 call was a call he made. To Jenn asking if she knew whether this guy Patrick was around. Jay was looking for weed from Patrick. Jenn, by the way, testified this never would have happened, that Jay would never call her asking about Patrick, but anyway. Here’s the third thing. The confusing kicker. Both Jay and Jenn also say Jay was at Jenn’s house until about 3:45 p.m. that day.,,Julie Snyder,That also has always confused me. If Jay is at Jenn’s house until 3:45, how is he calling Jenn’s house at 3:21? Why would he be calling the house that he’s sitting in it?,,Sarah Koenig,Unless Adnan has the phone.,,Julie Snyder,Unless Jay doesn’t have the phone. I’m not saying who has the phone. I have no idea who has the phone. But it leads me to believe that there is the possibility that Jay doesn’t have the phone.,,Sarah Koenig,So what’s the evidence that Jay does have the phone? Jenn tells the police that she saw Jay with the phone that afternoon. She has an image of the cell phone in her mind sitting on the coffee table at her house. But at 3:21, the tower that’s pinged isn’t the one that covers Jenn’s house. If Jay doesn’t have the phone though, then who has the phone? More to the point, if Jay doesn’t have the phone, then what was going on that afternoon? Then I have no idea what was going on.,There are discrepancies unresolved like this all throughout the afternoon and evening right up until the end of the night when there’s a big one. We noticed it right at the beginning, and while Adnan’s attorney does bring it up at trial, no one dwells on it too long. But it’s odd. Jenn and Jay tell different stories about where she picked him up on the night of the thirteenth, and about where and when they got rid of Jay’s clothes and boots. Jenn says she picked Jay up at Westview Mall, where she saw Adnan too. Jay says, --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

      "Error translating text: There was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, a merchant, who dwelt in the land of Bassorah and who owned two sons and wealth galore. But in due time Allah, the All-hearing the All-knowing, decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the Most High; so he died, and his two sons laid him out and buried him, after which they divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion each one opened a shop. Presently the elder son, Hasan hight, a youth of passing beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, betook himself to the company of lewd folk, women and low boys, frolicking with them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done, for that he exulted in the abundance of his good. After some time he had wasted all his ready money, so he sold all his father's lands and houses and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing, neither little nor muchel, nor was one of his comrades left who knew him. He abode thus anhungred, he and his widowed mother, three days, and on the fourth day, as he walked along, unknowing whither to wend, there met him a man of his father's friends, who questioned him of his case. He told him what had befallen him and the other said, \"O my son, I have a brother who is a goldsmith; an thou wilt, thou shalt be with him and learn his craft and become skilled therein.\" Hasan consented and accompanied him to his brother, to whom he commended him, saying, \"In very sooth this is my son; do thou teach him for my sake.\" So Hasan abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft; and Allah opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for himself. One day, as he sat in his booth in the bazar, there came up to him an Ajamí, a foreigner, a Persian, with a great white beard and a white turband on his head, having the semblance of a merchant who, after saluting him, looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly. It pleased him and he shook his head, saying, \"By Allah, thou art a cunning goldsmith! What may be thy name?\" \"Hasan,\" replied the other, shortly. The Persian continued to look at his wares, whilst Hasan read in an old book he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace, till the hour of midafternoon prayer, when the shop became clear of people and the Persian accosted the young man, saying, \"O my son, thou art a comely youth! What book is that? Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art, than which there is no goodlier in the world.\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian accosted the young man saying, \"O my son, thou art a comely youth! Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world. Many have sought of me instruction therein, but I consented not to instruct any of them in it; yet hath my soul consented that I teach it to thee, for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and I will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier, so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer and anvil, charcoal and fire.\" Hasan asked, \"O my lord and when wilt thou teach me this?\"; and the Persian answered, \"To-morrow, Inshallah, I will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of this copper.\" Whereupon Hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the Persian till nightfall, when he took leave of him and going in to his mother, saluted her with the salam and ate with her; but he was dazed, without memory or reason, for that the stranger's words had gotten hold upon his heart. So she questioned him and he told her what had passed between himself and the Persian, which when she heard, her heart fluttered and she strained him to her bosom, saying, \"O my son, beware of hearkening to the talk of the folk, and especially of the Persians, and obey them not in aught; for they are sharpers and tricksters, who profess the art of alchemy and swindle people and take their money and devour it in vain.\" Replied Hasan, \"O my mother, we are paupers and have nothing he may covet, that he should put a cheat on us. Indeed, this Persian is a right worthy Shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him; Allah hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son.\" She was silent in her chagrin, and he passed the night without sleep, his heart being full of what the Persian had said to him; nor did slumber visit him for the excess of his joy therein. But when morning morrowed, he rose and taking the keys, opened the shop, whereupon behold, the Persian accosted him. Hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands; but he forbade him from this and suffered it not, saying, \"O Hasan, set on the crucible and apply the bellows.\" So he did as the stranger bade him and lighted the charcoal. Then said the Persian, \"O my son, hast thou any copper?\" and he replied, \"I have a broken platter.\" So he bade him work the shears and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows, till the copper became liquid, when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper and opening it, sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of somewhat like yellow Kohl or eyepowder. Then he bade Hasan blow upon it with the bellows, and he did so, till the contents of the crucible became a lump of gold. When the youth saw this, he was stupefied and at his wits' end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it pure gold of the finest quality: whereupon his reason fled and he was dazed with excess of delight and bent over the Persian's hand to kiss it. But he forbade him, saying, \"Art thou married?\" and when the youth replied \"No!\" he said, \"Carry this ingot to the market and sell it and take the price in haste and speak not.\" So Hasan went down into the market and gave the bar to the broker, who took it and rubbed it upon the touchstone and found it pure gold. So they opened the biddings at ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up to fifteen thousand dirhams, at which price he sold it and taking the money, went home and told his mother all that had passed, saying, \"O my mother, I have learnt this art and mystery.\" But she laughed at him, saying, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eightieth Night,,,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the Ajami and cried, \"I have learnt this art and mystery,\" she laughed at him, saying, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"; and she was silent for vexation. Then of his ignorance, he took a metal mortar and returning to the shop, laid it before the Persian, who was still sitting there and asked him, \"O my son, what wilt thou do with this mortar?\" Hasan answered, \"Let us put it in the fire, and make of it lumps of gold.\" The Persian laughed and rejoined, \"O my son, art thou Jinn-mad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two ingots of gold in one day? Knowest thou not that the folk would suspect us and our lives would be lost? Now, O my son, an I teach thee this craft, thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth; for that will suffice thee from year to year.\" Cried Hasan, \"True, O my lord,\" and sitting down in his open shop, set on the crucible and cast more charcoal on the fire. Quoth the Persian, \"What wilt thou, O my son?\"; and quoth Hasan, \"Teach me this craft.\" \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" exclaimed the Persian, laughing; \"Verily, O my son, thou art little of wit and in nowise fitted for this noble craft. Did ever any during all his life learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars? If we busy ourselves with it here, the folk will say of us, These practise alchemy; and the magistrates will hear of us, and we shall lose our lives. Wherefore, O my son, an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright, come thou with me to my house.\" So Hasan barred his shop and went with that Ajamí; but by the way he remembered his mother's words and thinking in himself a thousand thoughts he stood still, with bowed head. The Persian turned and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him, \"Art thou mad? What! I in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest I will harm thee!\" presently adding, \"But, if thou fear to go with me to my house, I will go with thee to thine and teach thee there.\" Hasan replied, \"'Tis well, O uncle,\" and the Persian rejoined, \"Go thou before me.\" So Hasan led the way to his own house, and entering, told his mother of the Persian's coming, for he had left him standing at the door. She ordered the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and adorning it, her son bade her go to one of the neighbours' lodgings. So she left her home to them and wended her way, whereupon Hasan brought in the Persian, who entered after asking leave. Then he took in hand a dish and going to the market, returned with food, which he set before the Persian, saying, \"Eat, O my lord, that between us there may be bread and salt and may Almighty Allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and salt!\" The Persian replied with a smile, \"True, O my son! Who knoweth the virtue and worth of bread and salt?\" Then he came forward and ate with Hasan, till they were satisfied; after which the Ajami said, \"O my son Hasan, bring us somewhat of sweetmeats.\" So Hasan went to the market, rejoicing in his words, and returned with ten saucers of sweetmeats, of which they both ate and the Persian said, \"May Allah abundantly requite thee, O my son! It is the like of thee with whom folk company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may profit him!\" Then said he, \"O Hasan bring the gear.\" But hardly did Hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass in spring-tide, and hastening to the shop, fetched the apparatus and set it before the Persian, who pulled out a piece of paper and said, \"O Hasan, by the bond of bread and salt, wert thou not dearer to me than my son, I would not let thee into the mysteries of this art, for I have none of the Elixir left save what is in this paper; but by and by I will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before thee. Know, O my son Hasan, that to every ten pounds of copper thou must set half a drachm of that which is in this paper, and the whole ten will presently become unalloyed virgin gold;\" presently adding, \"O my son, O Hasan, there are in this paper three ounces, Egyptian measure, and when it is spent, I will make thee other and more.\" Hasan took the packet and finding therein a yellow powder, finer than the first, said to the Persian, \"O my lord, what is the name of this substance and where is it found and how is it made?\" But he laughed, longing to get hold of the youth, and replied, \"Of what dost thou question? Indeed thou art a froward boy! Do thy work and hold thy peace.\" So Hasan arose and fetching a brass platter from the house, shore it in shreds and threw it into the melting-pot; then he scattered on it a little of the powder from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold. When he saw this, he joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think of nothing save the gold; but, whilst he was occupied with taking up the lumps of metal from the melting-pot, the Persian pulled out of his turband in haste a packet of Cretan Bhang, which if an elephant smelt, he would sleep from night to night, and cutting off a little thereof, put it in a piece of the sweetmeat. Then said he, \"O Hasan, thou art become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth, and I have a daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace. Now I see that thou befittest none but her and she none but thee; wherefore, if it be Allah's will, I will marry thee to her.\" Replied Hasan, \"I am thy servant and whatso good thou dost with me will be a deposit with the Almighty!\" and the Persian rejoined, \"O my son, have fair patience and fair shall betide thee.\" Therewith he gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand, put it in his mouth, knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time for only the Lord of Futurity knoweth the Future. But hardly had he swallowed it, when he fell down, head foregoing heels, and was lost to the world; whereupon the Persian, seeing him in such calamitous case, rejoiced exceedingly and cried, \"Thou hast fallen into my snares, O gallows-carrion, O dog of the Arabs! This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee, O Hasan!\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-first Night,,,She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the Ajami and fell fainting to the ground, the Persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried, \"This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee!\" Then he girt himself and pinioned Hasan's arms and binding his feet to his hands laid him in a chest, which he emptied to that end and locked it upon him. Moreover, he cleared another chest and laying therein all Hasan's valuables, together with the piece of the first gold-lump and the second ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock. Then he ran to the market and fetching a porter, took up the two chests and made off with them to a place within sight of the city, where he set them down on the sea-shore, hard by a vessel at anchor there. Now this craft had been freighted and fitted out by the Persian and her master was awaiting him; so, when the crew saw him, they came to him and bore the two chests on board. Then the Persian called out to the Rais or Captain, saying, \"Up and let us be off, for I have done my desire and won my wish.\" So the skipper sang out to the sailors, saying, \"Weigh anchor and set sail!\" And the ship put out to sea with a fair wind. So far concerning the Persian; but as regards Hasan's mother, she awaited him till supper-time but heard neither sound nor news of him; so she went to the house and finding it thrown open, entered and saw none therein and missed the two chests and their valuables; wherefore she knew that her son was lost and that doom had overtaken him; and she buffeted her face and rent her raiment crying out and wailing and saying, \"Alas, my son, ah! Alas, the fruit of my vitals, ah!\" And she recited these couplets,,,\"My patience fails me and grows anxiety; * And with your absence,       &nbsp     growth of grief I see.,By Allah, Patience went what time ye went! * Loss of all Hope how,       &nbsp     suffer patiently?,When lost my loved one how can' joy I sleep? * Who shall enjoy,       &nbsp     such life of low degree?,Thou 'rt gone and, desolating house and home, * Hast fouled the,       &nbsp     fount erst flowed from foulness free:,Thou wast my fame, my grace 'mid folk, my stay; * Mine aid wast,       &nbsp     thou in all adversity!,Perish the day, when from mine eyes they bore * My friend, till,       &nbsp     sight I thy return to me!\",And she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn, when the neighbours came in to her and asked her of her son, and she told them what had befallen him with the Persian, assured that she should never, never see him again. Then she went round about the house, weeping, and wending she espied two lines written upon the wall; so she sent for a scholar, who read them to her; and they were these,,,\"Leyla's phantom came by night, when drowsiness had overcome me,,       &nbsp     towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the,       &nbsp     desert,,But when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom, I saw the air,       &nbsp     vacant and the place of visitation was distant.\",,When Hasan's mother heard these lines, she shrieked and said, \"Yes, O my son! Indeed, the house is desolate and the visitation-place is distant!\" Then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son, went away; but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write Hasan's name and the date of his loss, and thenceforward she quitted it not, but made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day. Such was her case; but touching her son Hasan and the Ajami, this Persian was a Magian, who hated Moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who fell into his power. He was a lewd and filthy villain, a hankerer after alchemy, an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards, such an one as he of whom quoth the poet,,,\"A dog, dog-fathered, by dog-grandsire bred; * No good in dog,       &nbsp     from dog race issued:,E'en for a gnat no resting-place gives he * Who is composed of,       &nbsp     seed by all men shed.\",,The name of this accursed was Bahrám the Guebre, and he was wont, every year, to take a Moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes. So, when he had carried out his plot against Hasan the goldsmith, they sailed on from dawn till dark, when the ship made fast to the shore for the night, and at sunrise, when they set sail again, Bahram bade his black slaves and white servants bring him the chest wherein were Hasan. They did so, and he opened it and taking out the young man, made him sniff up vinegar and blew a powder into his nostrils. Hasan sneezed and vomited the Bhang; then, opening his eyes, he looked about him right and left and found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail, and saw the Persian sitting by him; wherefore he knew that the accursed Magian had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril against which his mother had warned him. So he spake the saying which shall never shame the sayer, to wit, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verity, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning! O my God, be Thou gracious to me in Thine appointment and give me patience to endure this Thine affliction, O Lord of the three Worlds!\" Then he turned to the Persian and bespoke him softly, saying, \"O my father, what fashion is this and where is the covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to me?\" But Bahram stared at him and replied, \"O dog, knoweth the like of me bond of bread and salt? I have slain of youths like thee a thousand, save one, and thou shalt make up the thousand.\" And he cried out at him and Hasan was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-second Night,,,She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned Persian he bespoke him softly but gained naught thereby for the Ajami cried out at him in wrath, so he was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him. Then the accursed bade loose his pinion-bonds and they gave him a little water to drink, whilst the Magian laughed and said, \"By the virtue of the Fire and the Light and the Shade and the Heat, methought not thou wouldst fall into my nets! But the Fire empowered me over thee and helped me to lay hold upon thee, that I might win my wish and return and make thee a sacrifice, to her so she may accept of me.\" Quoth Hasan, \"Thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt\"; whereupon the Magus raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and, biting the deck with his fore-teeth, swooned away, whilst the tears trickled down his cheeks. Then the Guebre bade his servants light him a fire and Hasan said, \"What wilt thou do with it?\" Replied the Magian, \"This is the Fire, lady of light and sparkles bright! This it is I worship, and if thou wilt worship her even as I, verily I will give thee half my monies and marry thee to my maiden daughter.\" Thereupon Hasan cried angrily at him, \"Woe to thee! Thou art a miscreant Magian who to Fire dost pray in lieu of the King of Omnipotent sway, Creator of Night and Day; and this is naught but a calamity among creeds!\" At this the Magian was wroth and said to him, \"Wilt thou not then conform with me, O dog of the Arabs, and enter my faith?\" But Hasan consented not to this: so the accursed Guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire, bade his pages throw him flat on his face. They did so, and he beat him with a hide whip of plaited thongs till his flanks were laid open, whilst he cried aloud for aid but none aided him, and besought protection, but none protected him. Then he raised his eyes to the All-powerful King and sought of Him succour in the name of the Chosen Prophet. And indeed patience failed him; his tears ran down his cheeks, like rain, and he repeated these couplets twain,,,\"In patience, O my God, Thy doom forecast * I'll bear, an thereby,       &nbsp     come Thy grace at last:,They've dealt us wrong, transgressed and ordered ill; * Haply Thy,       &nbsp    Grace shall pardon what is past.\",Then the Magian bade his negro-slaves raise him to a sitting posture and bring him somewhat of meat and drink. So they sat food before him; but he consented not to eat or drink; and Bahram ceased not to torment him day and night during the whole voyage, whilst Hasan took patience and humbled himself in supplication before Almighty Allah to whom belong Honour and Glory; whereby the Guebre's heart was hardened against him. They ceased not to sail the sea three months, during which time Hasan was continually tortured till Allah Almighty sent forth upon them a foul wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship, by reason of the fierce gale; whereupon quoth the captain and crew, \"By Allah, this is all on account of yonder youth, who hath been these three months in torture with this Magian. Indeed, this is not allowed of God the Most High.\" Then they rose against the Magian and slew his servants and all who were with him; which when he saw, he made sure of death and feared for himself. So he loosed Hasan from his bonds and pulling off the ragged clothes the youth had on, clad him in others; and made excuses to him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native land, saying, \"O my son, return me not evil for that I have done with thee.\" Quoth Hasan, \"How can I ever rely upon thee again?\"; and quoth Bahram, \"O my son, but for sin, there were no pardon. Indeed, I did all these doings with thee, but to try thy patience, and thou knowest that the case is altogether in the hands of Allah.\" So the crew and captain rejoiced in Hasan's release, and he called down blessings on them and praised the Almighty and thanked Him. With this the wind was stilled and the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage. Then said Hasan to Bahram, \"O Master, whither wendest thou?\" Replied the Magian, \"O, my son, I am bound for the Mountain of Clouds, where is the Elixir which we use in alchemy.\" And the Guebre swore to him by the Fire and the Light that he had no longer any cause to fear him. So Hasan's heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the Persian's words, he continued to eat and drink and sleep with the Magian, who clad him in his own raiment. They ceased not sailing on other three months, when the ship came to anchor off a long shoreline of many coloured pebbles, white and yellow and sky-blue and black and every other hue, and the Magian sprang up and said, \"O Hasan, come, let us go ashore for we have reached the place of our wish and will.\" So Hasan rose and landed with Bahram, after the Persian had commended his goods to the captain's care. They walked on inland, till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight, when Bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettle-drum of copper and a silken strap, worked in gold with characts, beat the drum with the strap, until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste. Hasan marvelled at the Magian's doings and was afraid of him: he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed. But Bahram looked at him and said, \"What aileth thee, O my son? By the truth of the Fire and the Light, thou hast naught to fear from me; and, were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means, I had not brought thee ashore. So rejoice in all good; for yonder cloud of dust is the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereof.\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-third Night,,,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian said to Hasan, \"In very sooth yonder dust-cloud is the cloud of something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and will make easy to us the hardships thereof.\" Presently the dust lifted off three she-dromedaries, one of which Bahram mounted and Hasan another. Then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven days, till they came to a wide champaign and, descending into its midst, they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold; so they alighted and entering thereunder, ate and drank and took their rest. Anon Hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something lofty said to the Magian, \"What is that, O nuncle?\" Bahram replied, \"'Tis a palace,\" and quoth Hasan, \"Wilt thou not go thither, that we may enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting it?\" But the Persian was wroth and said, \"Name not to me yonder palace; for therein dwelleth a foe, with whom there befel me somewhat whereof this is no time to tell thee.\" Then he beat the kettle-drum and up came the dromedaries, and they mounted and fared on other seven days. On the eighth day, the Magian said, \"O Hasan, what seest thou?\" Hasan replied, \"I see clouds and mists twixt east and west.\" Quoth Bahram, \"That is neither clouds nor mists, but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the clouds split, and there are no clouds above it, for its exceeding height and surpassing elevation. Yon mount is my goal and thereon is the need we seek. 'Tis for that I brought thee hither, for my wish may not be won save at thy hands. Hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost and said to the Magian, \"By the right of that thou worshippest and by the faith wherein thou believest, I conjure thee to tell me what is the object wherefor thou hast brought me!\" Bahram replied, \"The art of alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split. Such a site is yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and I purpose to send thee up thither to fetch it; and when we have it, I will show thee the secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn.\" Hasan answered, in his fear, \"'Tis well, O my master;\" and indeed he despaired of life and wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead, repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two couplets,,,\"Consider but thy Lord, His work shall bring * Comfort to thee,,       &nbsp   with quick relief and near:,Despair not when thou sufferest sorest bane: * In bane how many,       &nbsp   blessed boons appear!\",,They ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that mountain where they halted; and Hasan saw thereon a palace and asked Bahram, \"What be yonder palace?\"; whereto he answered, \"'Tis the abode of the Jann and Ghuls and Satans.\" Then the Magian alighted and making Hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him, \"Bear me no ill will anent that I did with thee, for I will keep guard over thee in thine ascent to the palace; and I conjure thee not to trick and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom; and I and thou will share equally therein.\" And Hasan replied, \"To hear is to obey.\" Then Bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of wheat, ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour; after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks. Then he took out the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap, whereupon up came the dromedaries. He chose out one and said, \"Hearken, O my son, O Hasan, to what I am about to enjoin on thee;\" and Hasan replied, \"'Tis well.\" Bahram continued, \"Lie down on this skin and I will sew thee up therein and lay thee on the ground; whereupon the Rakham birds will come to thee and carry thee up to the mountain-top. Take this knife with thee; and, when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have set thee down, slit open therewith the skin and come forth. The vultures will then take fright at thee and fly away; whereupon do thou look down from the mountain head and speak to me, and I will tell thee what to do.\" So he sewed him up in the skin, placing therein three cakes and a leathern bottle full of water, and withdrew to a distance. Presently a vulture pounced upon him and taking him up, flew away with him to the mountain-top and there set him down. As soon as Hasan felt himself on the ground, he slit the skin and coming forth, called out to the Magian, who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy, saying to him, \"Look behind thee and tell me what thou seest.\" Hasan looked and seeing many rotten bones and much wood, told Bahram, who said to him, \"This be what we need and seek. Make six bundles of the wood and throw them down to me, for this is wherewithal we do alchemy.\" So he threw him the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to Hasan, \"O gallows bird, I have won my wish of thee; and now, if thou wilt, thou mayst abide on this mountain, or cast thyself down to the earth and perish. So saying, he left him and went away, and Hasan exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This hound hath played the traitor with me.\" And he sat bemoaning himself and reciting these couplets,,,\"When God upon a man possessed of reasoning, Hearing and sight,       &nbsp   His will in aught to pass would bring,,He stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit, From,       &nbsp    him, as one draws out the hairs to paste that cling;,Till, His decrees fulfilled, He gives him back His wit, That,       &nbsp   therewithal he may receive admonishing.,So say thou not of aught that haps, 'How happened it?' For Fate,       &nbsp    and fortune fixed do order everything.\",—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,,,She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Magian sent Hasan to the mountain-top and made him throw down all he required he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This damned hound hath played the traitor.\" Then he rose to his feet and looked right and left, after which he walked on along the mountain top, in mind making certain of death. He fared on thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain, along which he saw a dark-blue sea, dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves each as it were a lofty mount. So he sat down and repeated what he might of the Koran and besought Allah the Most High to ease him of his troubles, or by death or by deliverance from such strait. Then he recited for himself the funeral-prayer and cast himself down into the main; but, the waves bore him up by Allah's grace, so that he reached the water unhurt, and the angel in whose charge is the sea watched over him, so that the billows bore him safe to land, by the decree of the Most High. Thereupon he rejoiced and praised Almighty Allah and thanked Him; after which he walked on in quest of something to eat, for stress of hunger, and came presently to the place where he had halted with the Magian, Bahram. Then he fared on awhile, till behold, he caught sight of a great palace, rising high in air, and knew it for that of which he had  --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

One story week by week. I’m Sarah Koenig.,,The cops that investigated the murder of Hae Min Lee were both experienced Baltimore City detectives. Their names were Ritz and MacGillivary. Bill Ritz and Greg MacGillivary. And how I wish right now that I could play you tape of their perspective on this case, but they didn’t want to be interviewed. When Bill Ritz finally turned me down after six weeks of back and forth, he said he didn’t see the point. The case has been adjudicated. What good would it do? I also spoke on the phone, briefly, to MacGillivary and he said just a few sentences to me and one of them was “beyond question, he did it.” Meaning Adnan did it. He didn’t hem or haw or hesitate. He remembered the case right away. “Beyond question he did it.” How did they arrive at that level of certainty?,,Before Hae’s body was found, this was a missing person case. She disappeared January 13, and the investigation starts out a little slowly, which makes sense to me. She’s a not a small child, she’s eighteen. She’s got a car which is also missing. That first day, the police call around to her friends, they talk to Aisha, to Adnan, remember that’s when he tells them he was supposed to get a ride from her, but didn’t. The next day they call around to hospitals, hotels, motels, they check the area around the high school parking lot where she was last seen. You can see from their reports that they immediately hone in on the most time warn explanation for such disappearances: the boyfriends, current and former. That first day they call Don, her new guy. They check the area around his house which is in another county, northeast of Baltimore. Over the next two weeks they keep going back to Don, and to Adnan, asking more questions.,,They check Don’s alibi, he was indeed at Lenscrafters store the day Hae went missing, the manager tells them. And they talk to Adnan’s track coach to check Adnan’s alibi, and it’s inconclusive. The coach tells them he can’t be sure Adnan practiced that day. They don’t take attendance. On February 6, they do that awful, foreboding thing you see on TV sometimes, they take a team of dogs to check the wooded areas and fields around Woodlawn High School. They used Hae’s curling iron for a scent. On February 8, they make a report saying they’re going to check Hae’s computer, her AOL account, for clues. And then, on February 9, their search stops. And a new suspect emerges.,     Detective,     Testing one two three. Testing one two three.,,Sarah Koenig,This is tape from a police interview of the man who finds Hae. He’s a little hard to hear on the tape. He’s soft-spoken. I’m going to call this man Mr. S. I don’t want to use his real name for reasons that I promise will become clear. Mr. S works in the maintenance department at a local school.,,     Mr. S,     I think I may have discovered a body in Leakin Park.,,Sarah Koenig,“I think I may have discovered a body in Leakin Park,” he says. Before I get to the slightly off-kilter story about how Mr. S discovered this body, just a word here about Leakin Park. It’s actually spelled LEAKin Park, L-E-A-K-I-N, but almost everyone in Baltimore pronounces it Linkin’ Park. It’s huge, over 1000 acres. On the western edge of Baltimore city. It’s got a reputation and not for the beauty of its woods or its trails or its nature center. What it’s known for, sadly, is its dead bodies. Mention Leakin Park to people from Baltimore as I often did, and you’re pretty much guaranteed to get a comment like this:,,     Unidentified Man,     While you’re digging in Leakin Park to bury your body, you’re gonna find somebody else’s. That’s Leakin Park.,Sarah Koenig,When I told a rental car guy in west Baltimore I was working on a story about a girl who was found in Leakin Park, he said, “Oh yeah? My uncle was found dead in Leakin Park.” A macabre website dedicated to Baltimore murders lists sixty-eight bodies found there since 1946, though the list is missing at least seven years of stats and that number is probably low. A lot of law-abiding Baltimoreans, they don’t really know where Leakin Park is. Rabia Chaudry, that family friend of Adnan’s who first contacted me about this case, when she’s explaining it to me, she said, “Yeah and is Adnan supposed to get to Leakin Park so fast? It’s like an hour into the city.”,,     Rabia Chaudry,     Leakin Park is nowhere near the school.,Sarah Koenig,Her brother, Saad, Adnan’s best friend, he didn’t know anything about Leakin Park either.,,     Saad Chaudry,     After Adnan had initially got arrested, when I was on the phone with him, talking when he was locked up, I was like “Leakin Park? Where is that? Do you even know where that is? Have you ever been there?” And he was like “I have never been there. I don’t even know where it is.” So living around here, we don’t know but it’s somewhere in the inner city.,Sarah Koenig,Where Hae was found is in fact less than three miles from where Saad and Rabia are sitting right now, in an office across the street from Woodlawn High School. About a seven minute drive. They had no idea.,,     Saad Chaudry,     We wouldn’t go there. We’d go to the harbor or somewhere nice, but there’s no reason for us to go there.,,Sarah Koenig,I’m explaining all this just to say that, the simple fact that Hae was found in Leakin Park, for a lot of people that alone made Adnan look innocent. “What’s a nice boy like you doing in a park like this?”,,     Mr. S,     --and I walked around through the bushes and everything--,,Sarah Koenig,So now, Mr. S, he also told the cops he had never been to that part of Leakin Park before, though he did seem to know that people go fishing back there. Here’s what he told the cops.,,At his job, he had gotten a work order to shave down a door, but the school didn’t have the tool he needed, a plane. He had one at home though, so during his lunch hour he said he drove his truck home, got the plane from his basement, and before he left, grabbed some sustenance out of the fridge.,,     Mr. S,     I grabbed a beer out of my refrigerator. It was a 22-ounce Budweiser. I was drinking it on my way back to the school where I work at, and had to go to the bathroom, so I pulled over and I went further into the woods so nobody would see me urinate, and when I discovered what looked like a body--,,Sarah Koenig,So was drinking this 22-ounce Budweiser and he’s heading back to work and his route to the college is through Leakin Park, and suddenly he has to pee, badly, he says. He stops on Franklin Town Road, he’s about three miles from work, there’s a small pull off and some concrete barriers, and he walks back in there, quite a ways it seems like for a guy who just has to pee. Later they’d measure. 127 feet back into the woods is where he goes. This next tape is a little upsetting.,,     Mr. S,     --and I got back that way and I was getting ready to urinate and I looked down and seen something that looked like hair and something is covered under the dirt and it looked no good again and until I seen something that looked like a foot.,     Detective,     What drew your attention to the area that you went to? There was something there.,,     Mr. S,     It was an open area.,,     Detective,     An open area?,,     Mr. S,     Mm-hmm.,,     Detective,     But there was also a fallen tree, is that correct?,,     Mr. S,     Yes there was.,,     Detective,     Did you go to that area for a certain reason?,,     Mr. S,     No, no.,,     Detective,     No?,,     Mr. S,     No.,,Sarah Koenig,They are suspicious of Mr. S, who by this time has become a suspect in the case. This tape was made on February 18, nine days after Mr. S reported finding the body. They’re going over the details carefully because there are parts of his story that are a little weird. One of them is this thing about the fallen tree. 127 feet back into the woods there was a fallen tree, essentially a forty foot log, lying more or less parallel to the road. On the other side of the log, if you kept going, you’d have gotten to a stream with the unfortunate name of Dean Run. Hae’s body was buried right behind this log on the stream side. If you were standing  on the street side of the log, so on the other side, it’s not at all obvious that you’d notice her. So this story about why he stopped where he stopped, it doesn’t quite seem right. Here’s Bill Ritz.,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     When you’re walking back to this area where you finally stop, why did you pick that particular area?,,     Mr. S,     (unintelligible) pick that area. I was going to go back further except for that’s when I’d seen the hair and the foot. I left after that.,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     So you were actually going to go back further?,,     Mr. S,     Yes.,,Sarah Koenig,In this part of the tape, you get a sense of how Ritz and MacGillivary operate together, or at least what I gather from listening to a bunch of these interviews. MacGillivary starts all non-judgemental, “just tell me your story. Uh huh. Uh huh.” Then Ritz comes in and says something like, “just help me understand  here” and asks some harder question, exposing weaknesses in the narrative. Then MacGillivary will come back in but now it’s a tougher MacGillivary and he’s asking direct, sometimes harsh questions that seem like they’d be good at pushing someone off balance. Like this one, sort of out of the blue:,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     Have you ever been inside that girl’s car before?,,     Mr. S,     No.,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     No. Okay...,,Sarah Koenig,     Back to the fallen tree. Here, Ritz is saying “wait I thought you told MacGillivary you stopped at the log to pee, but now you’re saying that you were on your way farther back?”,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     --stop there, you said before you were getting ready to urinate and that’s when you looked down and discovered the hair. Now you’re saying you actually going to go back further?,,     Mr. S,     Before I discovered her.,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     Before you discovered her?,,     Mr. S,     Mm-hmm.,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     Maybe I’m a little bit confused. As you’re standing on the south side of the tree, between the tree and the road--,,Sarah Koenig,This doesn’t ever get cleared up really and they sort of let it go. But a bunch of things are fishy. The path he takes in the woods, it doesn’t really lead to the log. So why does he end up there? He didn’t need to head toward the log to find a spot to pee, there so many other choices. And if you’re walking through brush and brambles, wouldn’t you sort of naturally avoid a big log  you would need to step over? What they are trying to get at is, did you really just stumble on this body? Or were you looking for this body, because you already knew where it was? That is a reasonable question, because Hae’s body wasn’t just hard to spot, it was nearly impossible to spot.,,Alright, we’re in the State’s Attorney’s office, we just got delivered the first box of what they’re saying is discloseable under whatever public information act that I did.,,I didn’t understand how camouflaged the body was until I saw photos of the crime scene, the way Mr. S found it, before they removed the body. I was in the State’s Attorney’s office in Baltimore. I went there with a crime reporter from the Baltimore Sun. His name is Justin George. I had been talking to Justin about this story and he was interested in maybe writing about it too. We opened a packet of photos together. Some of them were awful to see as you’d imagine. There was one where you could make out a bit of black hair amid dirt and leaves.,,     Sarah Koenig,     How did he notice that?,,     Justin George,     How could he notice the body? I don’t understand that either. I mean it’s pretty well covered.,,     Sarah Koenig,     Yeah there’s barely anything showing. Wait are we supposed to be looking at something there? What is that? Is that her? That all he saw?,,     Justin George,     That looks to be part of the body. Yeah I expected it to be more visible than it is.,Sarah Koenig,Justin and I weren’t the only ones who had this reaction. The city surveyor, a guy named Philip Buddemayer went out to the burial site to measure the distance from the road. This is before they disintered her. Here’s Buddemayer testifying at trial.,,     Philip Buddemeyer,     When I arrived at the site where the body was, there was a log on the ground approximately forty feet long. I stepped over the log, I walked along the edge of the log expecting to find the body real soon. I never saw one, at which time had I taken one more step I would have walked on the gravesite where the body was.,,     Female Court Official,     And at that point there were others on the scene?,,     Philip Buddemeyer,     Yes ma’am. There was a lot of people there.,,     Female Court Official,     And at some point did someone point out to you the exact location--,,     Philip Buddemeyer,     Yes ma’am. The detective pointed out the site. I looked down at the ground, and I said “I don’t see any body.” It wasn’t freshly disturbed.,,     Female Court Official,     It was not freshly disturbed.,,     Philip Buddemeyer,     No. Yeah it just blended in with the natural surroundings of the ground.,,Sarah Koenig,So here’s a guy who’s looking for the body, who knows where it’s supposed to be, who can see there’s a bunch of people standing around it, and still he can’t find it. So does it seem reasonable that Mr. S who apparently  wasn’t looking for anything besides as secluded place to pee, discovered it? Just like that?,,The other thing that’s a little odd is this business of having to pee. The spot where Mr. S stops is only a few miles from his house, and only a few more miles from his work. Yet he can’t wait. Here’s Detective Ritz questioning Mr. S again.,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     While you were at home, did you have to use the bathroom at all?,,     Mr. S,     No. I didn’t feel I had to go at the time.,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     So within seven or eight minutes how much of the 22-ounce beer had you consumed?,,     Mr. S,     I think it was almost--,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     It was almost empty?,,     Mr. S,     Mm-hmm.,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     And that seven or eight minute period, you had to go to the bathroom, it was-- (cough) an urgent need would you need?,,     Mr. S,     Yes it was.,,Sarah Koenig,Yet Mr. S says he never did pee in the woods. Says he ended up waiting until he gets to work. Which, okay maybe that makes sense. He’d had a shock. But why would he walk so far in in the first place? He was just trying to have a quick pee. And why was he studying the ground? Ritz asks him about this.,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     You got out of your vehicle, ventured back into the woods, when we measured it it was 127 feet off the roadway. As you’re walking along, why are you looking down at the ground? Are you looking every step that you take or--,,     Mr. S,     So I didn’t stumble.,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     So you wouldn’t stumble?,,     Mr. S,     Mm-hmm.,,     Sarah Koenig,     Are you counting?,,     Justin George,     Uh-huh. Ten. Eleven. Twelve--,,Sarah Koenig,On a freezing day back in February of this year, we went out to Leakin Park. We wanted to know whether  it was strange that he’d gone so far back into the woods. Like, what did 127 feet from the road look like? My producer Dana was with me, and so was Justin George from the Baltimore Sun. Right at the place where  Mr. S had entered the woods, right at the road, Justin noticed a sign.,,     Sarah Koenig,     What’s that?,,     Justin George,     Look at it. I mean, the sign says a lot.,Sarah Koenig,It say’s “This area patrolled. Dumpers will be prosecuted.” You could barely read it. It’s hard to read a sign that’s covered in grafitti and pierced with seven bullet holes. In fact the cops found twenty cartrige casings in right about this spot when they collected evidence in 1999. Still I felt the park itself was quite lovely. Brambles and trees. It’s rocky near the stream. It’s uneven terrain, not hilly but it’s not flat either.,,     Sarah Koenig,     It’s not nearly as creepy as imagined it.,,     Justin George,     I think it is at night.,,     Sarah Koenig,     At night?,,     Justin George,     Yeah. I think at dusk, I think it is. Very bleak. Twenty-one. Twenty-two. Twenty-three--,,Sarah Koenig,We walked in what we thought was about 127 feet. Justin paced it out by the yard.,,     Justin George,     Forty-two. It would be right about there.,,Sarah Koenig,We actually wander around for a while, trying to find the right spot. Finally I remember we have a hand drawn map of the site, from that surveyor Buddemeyer who testified. Forty foot long, fifteen inch log on the ground.,,Once we get to the right location, it dawns on all of us, 127 feet back doesn’t feel all that far, if you’re looking for privacy. You can still see the cars on the road from where we’re standing.,,     Sarah Koenig,     So if he’s peeing, at least you’d want to come this far.,,     Dana Chivvis,     There’s not a lot of foliage--,,     Sarah Koenig,     There’s nothing. There’s some dead leaves or whatever, you can totally see the cars. So actually that doesn’t seem that weird to me.,,Sarah Koenig,Suddenly, Mr. S’s story seems eminently more believable. While we’re in the woods, I fill Justin in on the evidence they collected here.,,Right near the body was a liquor bottle from which they got cellular material and never tested. And a rope that was never tested, as far as I know. And then up at the road they found a condom and a condom wrapper but I think the condom was still rolled. I don’t think it was a used condom necessarily. And they found a bunch of shell casings. They found bullets and shell casings and stuff from two different guns. And they found two Blockbuster video cases. But by the body was the-- I think the only thing they got right from the area of the body was the liquor bottle and the rope.,,I know. It sounds like a game of Clue, except for the condom part. As for the liquor bottle, back at the taped interview with Mr. S, Detectives Ritz and MacGillivary want to find out if this guy could be the source of that liquor bottle. “Did you drink anything besides beer?” they ask. “Yeah,” he says. “What?” “Whiskey.” “What kind?” “Windsor Canadian whiskey.” “What denomination?” “Maybe half a pint.”,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     Did you ever take a bottle into the car with you also? A half pint? Did you ever take that in the car? Keep you warm?,,     Mr. S,     Sometimes.,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     Keep you warm?,,     Mr. S,     Mmm.,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     Take a nip here and there. Yes?,,     Mr. S,     Yes.,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     Okay.,,Sarah Koenig,Now Ritz comes in. “We’ve collected evidence,” he says. “Cans and bottles from the crime scene. We’re going to test them.” He’s bluffing here. They never do test. “Are we gonna find your DNA on one of those bottles?” he asks. “Maybe you threw a bottle out the window when you were driving past coming home from work. If so, you’d better tell us now.”,,     Detective Bill Ritz,     --and it’s important we know that because what we’re going to do is analyze that and come back six months or a month or three weeks from now and say “we have evidence that you were deceptive with us. We have DNA evidence that you were there.” And then you say:,,     Detective Ritz, I forgot because I’d gone fishing out there that weekend. I told you people go fishing out there. I told you I drank half a pint, and I threw a bottle (unintelligible) So take a minute and think if there are any of the items that I described. Whiskey bottles, beer bottles, soda cans, or anything like that where you may have discarded in that general area.,,     Mr. S,     I’m not sure. I could have, but I’m not positive cuz I know I throw a lot of bottles out the window.,,Sarah Koenig,He says, “I’m not sure. I could have, but I’m not positive cuz I know I throw a lot of bottles out the window.” Ah. Ritz asks, “What bottles?” “Beer bottles.” “Whiskey maybe?” “It’s possible,” he says. “Anything else?” Well for a while, he switched to rum. “What rum?” “Dark rum, Bacardi.” Finally MacGillivary can’t stand it, he just starts listing different kinds of booze.,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     No Jack?,,     Mr. S,     Not-- Probably a long time ago.,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     Vodka?,,     Mr. S,     Years ago.,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     Brandy?,,     Mr. S,     No, no brandy.,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     Cognac?,,     Mr. S,     No.,,     Detective Greg MacGillivary,     Just cheap stuff?,,     Mr. S,     Yeah.,,Sarah Koenig,“Just cheap stuff.” “Yeah.” Brandy! Brandy was the answer they were looking for. The bottle they found near Hae’s body was Coronet VSQ brandy. 200ML. And Mr. S? He blew right past it.,Consider for a moment, if Mr. S was just trying to relieve his bladder in peace that February day, minding his own business, and then he sees this terrible, sad sight and he does the right thing.,Tells the cops. Shows them where she’s buried. Well how horrible now that they’re so suspicious of him, that they’re considering that maybe either he did it or he knows who did. How terrifying for Mr. S. After all, he seems like a nice, quiet guy, cooperative. Doesn’t appear to be a brandy drinker. Again, I can only go by the reports and files, but my guess is the reason the cops are holding on to Mr. S as a suspect, is because Mr. S has a little bit of a record, which isn’t necessarily a big deal. But, and here’s the part of the story where you’ll understand why I’m not using name, Mr. S is a streaker. And not the frat party kind. The freaky kind.,,He’s got indecent exposure charges, to borrow a phrase from Adnan’s defense attorney, under circumstances that ‘bizarre’ doesn’t even begin to define. Mr. S is arrested May of ‘94 for running about naked in residential neighborhood. Two years later, March of ‘96, he’s spotted wearing a hoodie, sunglasses, white sneakers, and nothing else. The officer writes, “the southwestern district has received numerous calls for service in the past three years to this area for the same incident, same description.” Past three years! The officer chases down Mr. S onto I-95. Mr. S jumps some chain link fences, the kind with razor wire at the top, ends up in the hospital. It gets worse. Or better depending whether you enjoy police reports as much as I do. December 7, 1998, so barely two months before Mr. S finds Hae’s body there’s this. At around noon, during what I have to imagine is what Mr. S’s lunch break, a lady named Margaret is driving along and here’s the report “black male dashed out in front of my car and began shaking his body in a up and down motion. The male had on no clothes. His penis was exposed as he faced my vehicle, shaking.” And this lady, Margaret, is a police officer. In uniform! She chases him, but he runs down into the metro stop. Margaret finds his work clothes in a pile and takes them which means unless Mr. S has a second outfit stashed someplace, he’s riding back to work in the altogether.,,Then there’s another twist to this incident. The same day he flashes Margaret, so December 7, 1998, Mr. S files his own police report. “There’s been a theft,” he says, from his car. Someone has taken his cell phone, his money, his keys, his work clothes. But you and I, we know who has all of it. Officer Margaret.,,Streaking isn’t a violent crime. or necessarily a sexual one. And there’s no evidence that Hae was sexually assaulted anyway. But you could imagine both sets of eyebrows rising on Ritz and MacGillivary’s faces when they see these reports. It’s strange behavior. They never ask Mr. S about it on tape, but I figure he knew they knew. And they knew he knew they knew. The same day they interview him on tape, February 18, they also give him a polygraph test, which he fails. Deception indicated was the conclusion. But the testor also said Mr. S seemed to be nervous cuz apparently he had an important meeting with a realtor that day. His wife was expecting him to pick her up. So the tester recommends a do over. About a week later, they give him another polygraph. This time with different questions. For instance, “Do you know if that girl you found died because she was hit with a tire iron?” I guess that’s a thing. This time the result is: no deception indicated. He passes. And very quickly, Mr. S fades from their view.,,Here’s what my own thoughts were when I learned about Mr. S. I didn’t really think, “oh maybe he did it. Maybe he killed Hae.” But I did wonder if maybe he’d heard something about the crime and about where she was buried, because it did seem a tad unbelievable to me that he spotted her the way he said he did. One theory I had was maybe one of his step kids or a neighbor had told him about the body, because maybe they had heard about it through other kids at school. Then maybe Mr. S, just as a good samaritan thought, “someone needs to go find this girl, tell the cops.” But he doesn’t want to say he’s heard about it beforehand because he doesn’t want to get anyone else in trouble. Mr. S didn’t want to talk to me. After I made several requests, he asked if I would please leave him alone. Fair enough.,,I tried every which way to figure out if he knew, or anyone in his family knew Adnan, or Jay, or any of the people Jay had told about the murder. And vice versa. Whether any of them had ever heard of Mr. S. I found no connections. The closest I got was, bear with me, I found out that Mr. S’s sister-in-law was a math teacher at Woodlawn back in 1999 when all this happened. So I called her. Hae was her student, she said. An excellent student. Top of the line. But she didn’t think Mr. S knew anything about the crime before he found the body. She put her husband on the phone, Mr. S’s younger half-brother. And he said, “you know what’s crazy? I used to live next door to the kid that did it!” That was back when Adnan was nine or ten. He said he used to throw the football around with him, that he always seemed like a nice kid. But again, he said he thought his brother stumbled on the body by accident. The he paused, chuckled and said, “I think he was running through the woods, streaking. And that’s how he found it.” When I told him that apparently he had stopped to take a pee, he said, “that’s possible too.”,,So, maybe Mr. S is telling the truth. After all, why would a guy who’s been in trouble, repeatedly for indecent exposure, seek out a dead girl, thus inevitably inviting more police contact to rain down upon him.,,Mr. S wasn’t the detective's only lead in this case. We know there were also looking at the boyfriends. And while I don’t exactly know why they are suspicions about Adnan start to percolate, I have an educated guess.

      "Error translating text: Neffa, nel corso della sua ormai trentennale carriera, ha sempre dimostrato un talento incredibile nel capire le infinite diramazioni del ritmo e della musica, qualità, questa, che gli ha permesso di muoversi trasversalmente per generi e stili differenti senza mai risultare inopportuno o fuori contesto. Franco Battiato, che Neffa ha avuto la possibilità di intervistare nel ’98 per MTV, scrisse (per quello che sarà per molto tempo l’album più venduto in Italia) un pezzo dal titolo “Segnali di vita” e i prime versi sembrano essere perfetti per la carriera che il “chico”, nato a Scafati ma cresciuto a Bologna, ha vissuto in prima persona: “Il tempo cambia molte cose nella vita / il senso, le amicizie, le opinioni / che voglia di cambiare che c'è in me / Si sente il bisogno di una propria evoluzione / sganciata dalle regole comuni”. Dall'hip hop al funk, dal jazz allo swing, dal hardcore metal alla musica napoletana; in lui la voglia di cambiare ed evolversi è tratto distintivo e artistico. Per l'Evergreen odierno cercheremo di rintracciare l'immagine di un Neffa in ascesa nell'olimpo dell'hip hop nostrano, quando si vedeva in lui, e nella sua “ballotta”, l’immagine del messaggero, in terra vergine, del genere.,,Se c'è una cosa che non sorprende più un assiduo frequentatore di YouTube, la piattaforma di condivisione video più famosa al mondo, è la magnificenza dell'algoritmo che sta alla base dei suggerimenti del video che si sta guardando. Sembra che ultimamente (lo si può evincere dalla giovane vita dei commenti sotto al video) questo tool abbia deciso di portare alla ribalta un cortometraggio italiano del 1997 semi-sconosciuto dal nome di “Fame Chimica”. Il regista, Paolo Vari, di questo piccolo racconto urbano, collocato nel quartiere milanese Giambellino, ne fece poi un film omonimo, forse più conosciuto ma che nella trasposizione perde il tratto caratteristico del cortometraggio, ovvero lo slang veritiero (che sembra essersi cristallizzato nella cultura giovanile della città) e l’immagine dei b-boy di quei tempi. Il termine “B-boy” viene coniato nel 1969 da uno, se non il vero fondatore, dell’hip-hop, DJ Kool Herc, che durante i suoi set era solito a chiamare a raccolta i ballerini di breakdance con la frase \"b-boys go down!”. In quegli stessi anni, James Brown, artista nominato molte volte nelle sue liriche e decisamente amato da Neffa, infiammava il pubblico con le sue performance votate al movimento irresistibile e inevitabile scaturito dal ritmo funk-soul. Nel passare degli anni il termine assunse via via il carattere associativo e più generale di “amante dell'hip hop”.,Ritornando al corto “Fame Chimica”; questo narra le vicende di una notte brava del protagonista, Manuel Zanuso, “zarro” (tamarro) milanese e pusher di quartiere, che cerca di muoversi nella realtà eterogenea della cultura hip hop milanese negli ultimi anni del ‘900. Manuel è, sì, un pusher, ma è anche un giovane ragazzo (non ancora maggiorenne) che vuole divertirsi e stringere amicizie con i suoi clienti. Il suo sporco lavoro gli darà quindi la possibilità di addentrarsi in diverse situazioni che un b-boy di quei tempi esperiva: dalle feste anti-proibizioniste nei centri sociali al writing notturno nelle stazioni ferroviarie abbandonate al controllo di un solo sorvegliante. Ed è proprio durante quest'ultima scena che la colonna sonora del cortometraggio ci regala una perla dell'album, di recente uscita, “Neffa E I Messaggeri Della Dopa”, ovvero “I Fieri Bboyz”.,,Esce il 14 maggio del 1996, edito da Black Out e Mercury Records, ed è il primo album solista di Neffa dopo le esperienze con Isola Posse All Stars e Sangue Misto. In esso però troviamo tutti i suoi compagni di viaggio e di musica che lo hanno accompagnato dal 1992 al 1995, i “messaggeri della dopa” appunto: Phase II, Kaos, Dre Love, DJ Lugi, Esa, Storyteller, DJ Gruff, Fuckin' Camelz 'n Effect (poi diventati Camelz Finnezza Click), TopCat, Fede, Leftside, P.P.T. (ossia Chef Ragoo) e Cenzou. Dirà nel documentario “Numero Zero – Alle origini del rap italiano”: “Quando ebbi questo contratto il primo pensiero fu “voglio che tutti questi ragazzi abbiano la possibilità di andare in uno studio più carino, fare le cose per bene, prendere qualche soldo, tutto quanto”. E quindi per me era impensabile fare un disco solista da solo: ci fu il lavoro di Deda e poi tutte le persone che avevo conosciuto in quegli anni girando per tutte le realtà italiane, ho cercato di rappresentarli il più possibile.” Tutti i pezzi del disco sono prodotti dallo stesso Neffa tranne due, prodotti dal socio Deda, “La Ballotta” ed il celebre singolo “Aspettando il Sole”, che vede la partecipazione del cantante dei Casino Royale, Giuliano Palma. Questo singolo farà impattare l'universo hip hop nelle radio e, quindi, alle orecchie impreparate degli ascoltatori italiani, che rimangono folgorati dalla base e il suono sostenuto ma scarno e dal testo nostalgico ma speranzoso. Neffa decide di battersi (come faranno per almeno vent'anni molti altri rapper e producer) per innalzare lo status dell'hip hop, allora considerato divertissement per gli adolescenti, a vero e proprio genere e arte musicale intrecciata alla radice black da cui è scaturito (quindi al funk e al soul). Proprio per questa sua missione decide di ispirarsi ad Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, un peso massimo del jazz americano e internazionale. L’alchimia e la matematica musicale dicono che l'addizione di jazz, soul e funk darà sempre come risultato hip hop e così è stato.,,Addentriamoci ora nella canzone dell'Evergreen, “I Fieri Bboyz”, vero e proprio inno di tutti i b-boy e b-girl di tutta la penisola, che vede la partecipazione di un liricista fenomenale, Kaos One.,,“B-B-boys and b-b-girls”,,La canzone inizia con un sample, che fungerà da hook per tutto il pezzo, di “Breakers Revenge 93” di Zeb-Roc-Ski & Stieber Twins, che chiama, appunto a raccolta tutti gli amanti dell'hip hop.,,“Lo vedi dallo sguardo strano che ho sul viso,L'espressione che promette niente in dolce,Senza sorriso, a prima vista quieto,Ma è un errore di giudizio quantomeno grossolano,Non metterti mai contro un b-boy fiero,Come fumo azzurro ti volteggia intorno,Cerchi di colpirlo, ma un b-boy fiero quando è serio è troppo svelto,Sul marmo vola e non lo puoi fermare, non lo puoi vedere”,,In questa prima parte della strofa, Kaos, sta parlando delle caratteristiche del b-boy, per poi dopo, nel riferimento al marmo, concentrarsi sulla figura del breakdancer. Un b-boy anche quando non balla, segue lo stile di vita del movimento hip hop e quando si trova di fronte a una sfida egli diventa un \"guerriero\" e la componente aggressiva vale tanto quanto quella artistico/espressiva.,,“Veloce come la mano sul vinile sull'acciaio,Sul muro lascia traccia di colore come un codice ",
      "Il concetto che ti estraneo rende tutto più difficile,Il disegno è complicato come un puzzle da tremila pezzi,Se vuoi capire tocca che li incastri tutti”,Se nella prima parte della strofa Kaos ha parlato di una sola delle quattro arti dell'universo hip hop, subito dopo cita lo scratching (l'arte del turntablism) e il graffitismo. È un'arte ai più sconosciuta ma che in questo status di semi-clandestinità unisce le persone che la vivono.,,\"Come un crumiro sono un b-boy fiero,Because I represent just from my gente e un forte scrauso,Recluso come Silvio Pellico, le mie prigioni sono un incubo,Mentale, tocca di uscire e come sai\",,“Le mie prigioni” è un libro di memorie scritto da Silvio Pellico e pubblicato nel 1832.,Mentre Pellico, però, fu veramente incarcerato dagli austriaci, le prigioni per Kaos hanno più un valore metafisico e sono, appunto, viste come incubi dai cui è obbligatorio a uscire.,,\"La fotta di un b-boy non si esaurisce mai,Se vuoi restare resta, se no bye bye,Qui non c'è la festa,Solo gente che ti spacca il culo con la dopa, prendi nota,La strada per il funk per te è in salita,Studia, niente scorciatoie o giochi di prestigio,C'è solo hiphop che si trasmette per contagio,Questo in casa tua, nel tuo video, nel tuo stereo,Prendilo per vero come un b-boy fiero\",,Anche qui, come più avanti nella canzone, vengono portati alla luce elementi interessanti per capire come vivevano quella cultura in quei giorni. Ad esempio il fatto che per riuscire in quel contesto non ci fossero scorciatoie, in quanto l’hip hop era incollato all’asfalto da cui era nato e distante dal primato nel mainstream dei giorni nostri. Un altro elemento interessante è la dimensione dello “studio”, ma la vedremo più avanti.,,\"La dopa che smazzo, di fisso ti spacca,La rima che io caccio stona come Th,Metto fuoco alla ballotta quando faccio su,Perché è il chico con la fotta che non smette più,Eh yo, ogni momento è buono e mo cercami,Un paio di minuti e potrei anche non esserci, chica,Ah, via lascia che sia,Musica che avvolge l'energia, questo suono in azione,Sopra il beat sangue di un guaglione,Qui chi c'è, Snefs con la nuova trasmissione\",La strofa di Neffa inizia con lo slang e con le figure ricorrenti all’inizio della sua discografia: la dopa, il TH(C), la ballotta, il chico, la fotta, il guaglione. Interessante notare l’associazione della doppia coppia “musica - energia” e “suono - azione”. Non è così ricorrente ai giorni d’oggi sentire una canzone così votata all’esperienza condivisa di un suono che causa fermento e movimento per le strade.,,\"B-boy fiero un tot,Sono messaggero della dopa e rappresento la cultura hip hop,Quel che c'è, quel che avrai, quel che avrai, già sai,I breakers, i writers, le jam di freestyle\",,In quello che è una sorta di manifesto dell'album, Neffa in questa strofa narra e racconta quello che era la cultura hip-hop negli anni ’90.,,\"Dimentica gli spot e Non È La Rai ",
      ", Ambra,Sai che se fa il rap, alli guai\",,Distanti dalla recente rivalutazione dell'operato artistico di Ambra (Angiolini) da parte di Marracash in “Persona”, qui il “chico” si tiene bene a distanza da quello che allora era uno dei programmi più amati dagli italiani.,,\"Ama il rap, studia il rap, smetti di sporcare il rap,Devi imparare a rispettare il rap, chico, Snefs,Lancia questo monito,Fa che un messaggero porti a termine il suo compito,Quando faccio faccio subito, rapido, nitido,Dipingo frasi un tot vivide,Imparo all'arte, sparo all'arte,Un chico come me crede al funk dopo la morte,Questo è per i...\",,Ed ecco ritornare la dimensione dello “studio”. Neffa utilizza verosimilmente termini scolastici per parlare dell’arte che ama che, però, a differenza delle materie insegnate negli istituti superiori, è aderente alla realtà della strada che ha le sue regole e una sua didattica. Si deve essere in grado di stare in strada perché lì, a differenza di quello dei mass media, non ci sono scorciatoie e i limiti tra ciò che è legittimo e ciò che non lo è, è vincolato dalle tue sole azioni. Ecco quello a cui Manuel Zanuso va incontro nella sua pazza notte, fatta di droghe, musiche diverse, persone strane e consumate ma figlie del suo stesso ambiente in cui si è destinati alla sopravvivenza.Embed --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

      "Error translating text: There was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, a merchant, who dwelt in the land of Bassorah and who owned two sons and wealth galore. But in due time Allah, the All-hearing the All-knowing, decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the Most High; so he died, and his two sons laid him out and buried him, after which they divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion each one opened a shop. Presently the elder son, Hasan hight, a youth of passing beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, betook himself to the company of lewd folk, women and low boys, frolicking with them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done, for that he exulted in the abundance of his good. After some time he had wasted all his ready money, so he sold all his father's lands and houses and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing, neither little nor muchel, nor was one of his comrades left who knew him. He abode thus anhungred, he and his widowed mother, three days, and on the fourth day, as he walked along, unknowing whither to wend, there met him a man of his father's friends, who questioned him of his case. He told him what had befallen him and the other said, \"O my son, I have a brother who is a goldsmith; an thou wilt, thou shalt be with him and learn his craft and become skilled therein.\" Hasan consented and accompanied him to his brother, to whom he commended him, saying, \"In very sooth this is my son; do thou teach him for my sake.\" So Hasan abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft; and Allah opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for himself. One day, as he sat in his booth in the bazar, there came up to him an Ajamí, a foreigner, a Persian, with a great white beard and a white turband on his head, having the semblance of a merchant who, after saluting him, looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly. It pleased him and he shook his head, saying, \"By Allah, thou art a cunning goldsmith! What may be thy name?\" \"Hasan,\" replied the other, shortly. The Persian continued to look at his wares, whilst Hasan read in an old book he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace, till the hour of midafternoon prayer, when the shop became clear of people and the Persian accosted the young man, saying, \"O my son, thou art a comely youth! What book is that? Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art, than which there is no goodlier in the world.\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian accosted the young man saying, \"O my son, thou art a comely youth! Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world. Many have sought of me instruction therein, but I consented not to instruct any of them in it; yet hath my soul consented that I teach it to thee, for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and I will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier, so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer and anvil, charcoal and fire.\" Hasan asked, \"O my lord and when wilt thou teach me this?\"; and the Persian answered, \"To-morrow, Inshallah, I will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of this copper.\" Whereupon Hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the Persian till nightfall, when he took leave of him and going in to his mother, saluted her with the salam and ate with her; but he was dazed, without memory or reason, for that the stranger's words had gotten hold upon his heart. So she questioned him and he told her what had passed between himself and the Persian, which when she heard, her heart fluttered and she strained him to her bosom, saying, \"O my son, beware of hearkening to the talk of the folk, and especially of the Persians, and obey them not in aught; for they are sharpers and tricksters, who profess the art of alchemy and swindle people and take their money and devour it in vain.\" Replied Hasan, \"O my mother, we are paupers and have nothing he may covet, that he should put a cheat on us. Indeed, this Persian is a right worthy Shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him; Allah hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son.\" She was silent in her chagrin, and he passed the night without sleep, his heart being full of what the Persian had said to him; nor did slumber visit him for the excess of his joy therein. But when morning morrowed, he rose and taking the keys, opened the shop, whereupon behold, the Persian accosted him. Hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands; but he forbade him from this and suffered it not, saying, \"O Hasan, set on the crucible and apply the bellows.\" So he did as the stranger bade him and lighted the charcoal. Then said the Persian, \"O my son, hast thou any copper?\" and he replied, \"I have a broken platter.\" So he bade him work the shears and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows, till the copper became liquid, when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper and opening it, sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of somewhat like yellow Kohl or eyepowder. Then he bade Hasan blow upon it with the bellows, and he did so, till the contents of the crucible became a lump of gold. When the youth saw this, he was stupefied and at his wits' end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it pure gold of the finest quality: whereupon his reason fled and he was dazed with excess of delight and bent over the Persian's hand to kiss it. But he forbade him, saying, \"Art thou married?\" and when the youth replied \"No!\" he said, \"Carry this ingot to the market and sell it and take the price in haste and speak not.\" So Hasan went down into the market and gave the bar to the broker, who took it and rubbed it upon the touchstone and found it pure gold. So they opened the biddings at ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up to fifteen thousand dirhams, at which price he sold it and taking the money, went home and told his mother all that had passed, saying, \"O my mother, I have learnt this art and mystery.\" But she laughed at him, saying, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eightieth Night,,,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the Ajami and cried, \"I have learnt this art and mystery,\" she laughed at him, saying, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"; and she was silent for vexation. Then of his ignorance, he took a metal mortar and returning to the shop, laid it before the Persian, who was still sitting there and asked him, \"O my son, what wilt thou do with this mortar?\" Hasan answered, \"Let us put it in the fire, and make of it lumps of gold.\" The Persian laughed and rejoined, \"O my son, art thou Jinn-mad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two ingots of gold in one day? Knowest thou not that the folk would suspect us and our lives would be lost? Now, O my son, an I teach thee this craft, thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth; for that will suffice thee from year to year.\" Cried Hasan, \"True, O my lord,\" and sitting down in his open shop, set on the crucible and cast more charcoal on the fire. Quoth the Persian, \"What wilt thou, O my son?\"; and quoth Hasan, \"Teach me this craft.\" \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" exclaimed the Persian, laughing; \"Verily, O my son, thou art little of wit and in nowise fitted for this noble craft. Did ever any during all his life learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars? If we busy ourselves with it here, the folk will say of us, These practise alchemy; and the magistrates will hear of us, and we shall lose our lives. Wherefore, O my son, an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright, come thou with me to my house.\" So Hasan barred his shop and went with that Ajamí; but by the way he remembered his mother's words and thinking in himself a thousand thoughts he stood still, with bowed head. The Persian turned and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him, \"Art thou mad? What! I in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest I will harm thee!\" presently adding, \"But, if thou fear to go with me to my house, I will go with thee to thine and teach thee there.\" Hasan replied, \"'Tis well, O uncle,\" and the Persian rejoined, \"Go thou before me.\" So Hasan led the way to his own house, and entering, told his mother of the Persian's coming, for he had left him standing at the door. She ordered the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and adorning it, her son bade her go to one of the neighbours' lodgings. So she left her home to them and wended her way, whereupon Hasan brought in the Persian, who entered after asking leave. Then he took in hand a dish and going to the market, returned with food, which he set before the Persian, saying, \"Eat, O my lord, that between us there may be bread and salt and may Almighty Allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and salt!\" The Persian replied with a smile, \"True, O my son! Who knoweth the virtue and worth of bread and salt?\" Then he came forward and ate with Hasan, till they were satisfied; after which the Ajami said, \"O my son Hasan, bring us somewhat of sweetmeats.\" So Hasan went to the market, rejoicing in his words, and returned with ten saucers of sweetmeats, of which they both ate and the Persian said, \"May Allah abundantly requite thee, O my son! It is the like of thee with whom folk company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may profit him!\" Then said he, \"O Hasan bring the gear.\" But hardly did Hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass in spring-tide, and hastening to the shop, fetched the apparatus and set it before the Persian, who pulled out a piece of paper and said, \"O Hasan, by the bond of bread and salt, wert thou not dearer to me than my son, I would not let thee into the mysteries of this art, for I have none of the Elixir left save what is in this paper; but by and by I will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before thee. Know, O my son Hasan, that to every ten pounds of copper thou must set half a drachm of that which is in this paper, and the whole ten will presently become unalloyed virgin gold;\" presently adding, \"O my son, O Hasan, there are in this paper three ounces, Egyptian measure, and when it is spent, I will make thee other and more.\" Hasan took the packet and finding therein a yellow powder, finer than the first, said to the Persian, \"O my lord, what is the name of this substance and where is it found and how is it made?\" But he laughed, longing to get hold of the youth, and replied, \"Of what dost thou question? Indeed thou art a froward boy! Do thy work and hold thy peace.\" So Hasan arose and fetching a brass platter from the house, shore it in shreds and threw it into the melting-pot; then he scattered on it a little of the powder from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold. When he saw this, he joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think of nothing save the gold; but, whilst he was occupied with taking up the lumps of metal from the melting-pot, the Persian pulled out of his turband in haste a packet of Cretan Bhang, which if an elephant smelt, he would sleep from night to night, and cutting off a little thereof, put it in a piece of the sweetmeat. Then said he, \"O Hasan, thou art become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth, and I have a daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace. Now I see that thou befittest none but her and she none but thee; wherefore, if it be Allah's will, I will marry thee to her.\" Replied Hasan, \"I am thy servant and whatso good thou dost with me will be a deposit with the Almighty!\" and the Persian rejoined, \"O my son, have fair patience and fair shall betide thee.\" Therewith he gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand, put it in his mouth, knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time for only the Lord of Futurity knoweth the Future. But hardly had he swallowed it, when he fell down, head foregoing heels, and was lost to the world; whereupon the Persian, seeing him in such calamitous case, rejoiced exceedingly and cried, \"Thou hast fallen into my snares, O gallows-carrion, O dog of the Arabs! This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee, O Hasan!\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-first Night,,,She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the Ajami and fell fainting to the ground, the Persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried, \"This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee!\" Then he girt himself and pinioned Hasan's arms and binding his feet to his hands laid him in a chest, which he emptied to that end and locked it upon him. Moreover, he cleared another chest and laying therein all Hasan's valuables, together with the piece of the first gold-lump and the second ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock. Then he ran to the market and fetching a porter, took up the two chests and made off with them to a place within sight of the city, where he set them down on the sea-shore, hard by a vessel at anchor there. Now this craft had been freighted and fitted out by the Persian and her master was awaiting him; so, when the crew saw him, they came to him and bore the two chests on board. Then the Persian called out to the Rais or Captain, saying, \"Up and let us be off, for I have done my desire and won my wish.\" So the skipper sang out to the sailors, saying, \"Weigh anchor and set sail!\" And the ship put out to sea with a fair wind. So far concerning the Persian; but as regards Hasan's mother, she awaited him till supper-time but heard neither sound nor news of him; so she went to the house and finding it thrown open, entered and saw none therein and missed the two chests and their valuables; wherefore she knew that her son was lost and that doom had overtaken him; and she buffeted her face and rent her raiment crying out and wailing and saying, \"Alas, my son, ah! Alas, the fruit of my vitals, ah!\" And she recited these couplets,,,\"My patience fails me and grows anxiety; * And with your absence,       &nbsp     growth of grief I see.,By Allah, Patience went what time ye went! * Loss of all Hope how,       &nbsp     suffer patiently?,When lost my loved one how can' joy I sleep? * Who shall enjoy,       &nbsp     such life of low degree?,Thou 'rt gone and, desolating house and home, * Hast fouled the,       &nbsp     fount erst flowed from foulness free:,Thou wast my fame, my grace 'mid folk, my stay; * Mine aid wast,       &nbsp     thou in all adversity!,Perish the day, when from mine eyes they bore * My friend, till,       &nbsp     sight I thy return to me!\",And she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn, when the neighbours came in to her and asked her of her son, and she told them what had befallen him with the Persian, assured that she should never, never see him again. Then she went round about the house, weeping, and wending she espied two lines written upon the wall; so she sent for a scholar, who read them to her; and they were these,,,\"Leyla's phantom came by night, when drowsiness had overcome me,,       &nbsp     towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the,       &nbsp     desert,,But when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom, I saw the air,       &nbsp     vacant and the place of visitation was distant.\",,When Hasan's mother heard these lines, she shrieked and said, \"Yes, O my son! Indeed, the house is desolate and the visitation-place is distant!\" Then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son, went away; but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write Hasan's name and the date of his loss, and thenceforward she quitted it not, but made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day. Such was her case; but touching her son Hasan and the Ajami, this Persian was a Magian, who hated Moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who fell into his power. He was a lewd and filthy villain, a hankerer after alchemy, an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards, such an one as he of whom quoth the poet,,,\"A dog, dog-fathered, by dog-grandsire bred; * No good in dog,       &nbsp     from dog race issued:,E'en for a gnat no resting-place gives he * Who is composed of,       &nbsp     seed by all men shed.\",,The name of this accursed was Bahrám the Guebre, and he was wont, every year, to take a Moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes. So, when he had carried out his plot against Hasan the goldsmith, they sailed on from dawn till dark, when the ship made fast to the shore for the night, and at sunrise, when they set sail again, Bahram bade his black slaves and white servants bring him the chest wherein were Hasan. They did so, and he opened it and taking out the young man, made him sniff up vinegar and blew a powder into his nostrils. Hasan sneezed and vomited the Bhang; then, opening his eyes, he looked about him right and left and found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail, and saw the Persian sitting by him; wherefore he knew that the accursed Magian had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril against which his mother had warned him. So he spake the saying which shall never shame the sayer, to wit, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verity, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning! O my God, be Thou gracious to me in Thine appointment and give me patience to endure this Thine affliction, O Lord of the three Worlds!\" Then he turned to the Persian and bespoke him softly, saying, \"O my father, what fashion is this and where is the covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to me?\" But Bahram stared at him and replied, \"O dog, knoweth the like of me bond of bread and salt? I have slain of youths like thee a thousand, save one, and thou shalt make up the thousand.\" And he cried out at him and Hasan was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-second Night,,,She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned Persian he bespoke him softly but gained naught thereby for the Ajami cried out at him in wrath, so he was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him. Then the accursed bade loose his pinion-bonds and they gave him a little water to drink, whilst the Magian laughed and said, \"By the virtue of the Fire and the Light and the Shade and the Heat, methought not thou wouldst fall into my nets! But the Fire empowered me over thee and helped me to lay hold upon thee, that I might win my wish and return and make thee a sacrifice, to her so she may accept of me.\" Quoth Hasan, \"Thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt\"; whereupon the Magus raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and, biting the deck with his fore-teeth, swooned away, whilst the tears trickled down his cheeks. Then the Guebre bade his servants light him a fire and Hasan said, \"What wilt thou do with it?\" Replied the Magian, \"This is the Fire, lady of light and sparkles bright! This it is I worship, and if thou wilt worship her even as I, verily I will give thee half my monies and marry thee to my maiden daughter.\" Thereupon Hasan cried angrily at him, \"Woe to thee! Thou art a miscreant Magian who to Fire dost pray in lieu of the King of Omnipotent sway, Creator of Night and Day; and this is naught but a calamity among creeds!\" At this the Magian was wroth and said to him, \"Wilt thou not then conform with me, O dog of the Arabs, and enter my faith?\" But Hasan consented not to this: so the accursed Guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire, bade his pages throw him flat on his face. They did so, and he beat him with a hide whip of plaited thongs till his flanks were laid open, whilst he cried aloud for aid but none aided him, and besought protection, but none protected him. Then he raised his eyes to the All-powerful King and sought of Him succour in the name of the Chosen Prophet. And indeed patience failed him; his tears ran down his cheeks, like rain, and he repeated these couplets twain,,,\"In patience, O my God, Thy doom forecast * I'll bear, an thereby,       &nbsp     come Thy grace at last:,They've dealt us wrong, transgressed and ordered ill; * Haply Thy,       &nbsp    Grace shall pardon what is past.\",Then the Magian bade his negro-slaves raise him to a sitting posture and bring him somewhat of meat and drink. So they sat food before him; but he consented not to eat or drink; and Bahram ceased not to torment him day and night during the whole voyage, whilst Hasan took patience and humbled himself in supplication before Almighty Allah to whom belong Honour and Glory; whereby the Guebre's heart was hardened against him. They ceased not to sail the sea three months, during which time Hasan was continually tortured till Allah Almighty sent forth upon them a foul wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship, by reason of the fierce gale; whereupon quoth the captain and crew, \"By Allah, this is all on account of yonder youth, who hath been these three months in torture with this Magian. Indeed, this is not allowed of God the Most High.\" Then they rose against the Magian and slew his servants and all who were with him; which when he saw, he made sure of death and feared for himself. So he loosed Hasan from his bonds and pulling off the ragged clothes the youth had on, clad him in others; and made excuses to him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native land, saying, \"O my son, return me not evil for that I have done with thee.\" Quoth Hasan, \"How can I ever rely upon thee again?\"; and quoth Bahram, \"O my son, but for sin, there were no pardon. Indeed, I did all these doings with thee, but to try thy patience, and thou knowest that the case is altogether in the hands of Allah.\" So the crew and captain rejoiced in Hasan's release, and he called down blessings on them and praised the Almighty and thanked Him. With this the wind was stilled and the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage. Then said Hasan to Bahram, \"O Master, whither wendest thou?\" Replied the Magian, \"O, my son, I am bound for the Mountain of Clouds, where is the Elixir which we use in alchemy.\" And the Guebre swore to him by the Fire and the Light that he had no longer any cause to fear him. So Hasan's heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the Persian's words, he continued to eat and drink and sleep with the Magian, who clad him in his own raiment. They ceased not sailing on other three months, when the ship came to anchor off a long shoreline of many coloured pebbles, white and yellow and sky-blue and black and every other hue, and the Magian sprang up and said, \"O Hasan, come, let us go ashore for we have reached the place of our wish and will.\" So Hasan rose and landed with Bahram, after the Persian had commended his goods to the captain's care. They walked on inland, till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight, when Bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettle-drum of copper and a silken strap, worked in gold with characts, beat the drum with the strap, until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste. Hasan marvelled at the Magian's doings and was afraid of him: he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed. But Bahram looked at him and said, \"What aileth thee, O my son? By the truth of the Fire and the Light, thou hast naught to fear from me; and, were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means, I had not brought thee ashore. So rejoice in all good; for yonder cloud of dust is the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereof.\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-third Night,,,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian said to Hasan, \"In very sooth yonder dust-cloud is the cloud of something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and will make easy to us the hardships thereof.\" Presently the dust lifted off three she-dromedaries, one of which Bahram mounted and Hasan another. Then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven days, till they came to a wide champaign and, descending into its midst, they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold; so they alighted and entering thereunder, ate and drank and took their rest. Anon Hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something lofty said to the Magian, \"What is that, O nuncle?\" Bahram replied, \"'Tis a palace,\" and quoth Hasan, \"Wilt thou not go thither, that we may enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting it?\" But the Persian was wroth and said, \"Name not to me yonder palace; for therein dwelleth a foe, with whom there befel me somewhat whereof this is no time to tell thee.\" Then he beat the kettle-drum and up came the dromedaries, and they mounted and fared on other seven days. On the eighth day, the Magian said, \"O Hasan, what seest thou?\" Hasan replied, \"I see clouds and mists twixt east and west.\" Quoth Bahram, \"That is neither clouds nor mists, but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the clouds split, and there are no clouds above it, for its exceeding height and surpassing elevation. Yon mount is my goal and thereon is the need we seek. 'Tis for that I brought thee hither, for my wish may not be won save at thy hands. Hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost and said to the Magian, \"By the right of that thou worshippest and by the faith wherein thou believest, I conjure thee to tell me what is the object wherefor thou hast brought me!\" Bahram replied, \"The art of alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split. Such a site is yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and I purpose to send thee up thither to fetch it; and when we have it, I will show thee the secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn.\" Hasan answered, in his fear, \"'Tis well, O my master;\" and indeed he despaired of life and wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead, repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two couplets,,,\"Consider but thy Lord, His work shall bring * Comfort to thee,,       &nbsp   with quick relief and near:,Despair not when thou sufferest sorest bane: * In bane how many,       &nbsp   blessed boons appear!\",,They ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that mountain where they halted; and Hasan saw thereon a palace and asked Bahram, \"What be yonder palace?\"; whereto he answered, \"'Tis the abode of the Jann and Ghuls and Satans.\" Then the Magian alighted and making Hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him, \"Bear me no ill will anent that I did with thee, for I will keep guard over thee in thine ascent to the palace; and I conjure thee not to trick and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom; and I and thou will share equally therein.\" And Hasan replied, \"To hear is to obey.\" Then Bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of wheat, ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour; after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks. Then he took out the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap, whereupon up came the dromedaries. He chose out one and said, \"Hearken, O my son, O Hasan, to what I am about to enjoin on thee;\" and Hasan replied, \"'Tis well.\" Bahram continued, \"Lie down on this skin and I will sew thee up therein and lay thee on the ground; whereupon the Rakham birds will come to thee and carry thee up to the mountain-top. Take this knife with thee; and, when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have set thee down, slit open therewith the skin and come forth. The vultures will then take fright at thee and fly away; whereupon do thou look down from the mountain head and speak to me, and I will tell thee what to do.\" So he sewed him up in the skin, placing therein three cakes and a leathern bottle full of water, and withdrew to a distance. Presently a vulture pounced upon him and taking him up, flew away with him to the mountain-top and there set him down. As soon as Hasan felt himself on the ground, he slit the skin and coming forth, called out to the Magian, who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy, saying to him, \"Look behind thee and tell me what thou seest.\" Hasan looked and seeing many rotten bones and much wood, told Bahram, who said to him, \"This be what we need and seek. Make six bundles of the wood and throw them down to me, for this is wherewithal we do alchemy.\" So he threw him the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to Hasan, \"O gallows bird, I have won my wish of thee; and now, if thou wilt, thou mayst abide on this mountain, or cast thyself down to the earth and perish. So saying, he left him and went away, and Hasan exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This hound hath played the traitor with me.\" And he sat bemoaning himself and reciting these couplets,,,\"When God upon a man possessed of reasoning, Hearing and sight,       &nbsp   His will in aught to pass would bring,,He stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit, From,       &nbsp    him, as one draws out the hairs to paste that cling;,Till, His decrees fulfilled, He gives him back His wit, That,       &nbsp   therewithal he may receive admonishing.,So say thou not of aught that haps, 'How happened it?' For Fate,       &nbsp    and fortune fixed do order everything.\",—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,,,She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Magian sent Hasan to the mountain-top and made him throw down all he required he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This damned hound hath played the traitor.\" Then he rose to his feet and looked right and left, after which he walked on along the mountain top, in mind making certain of death. He fared on thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain, along which he saw a dark-blue sea, dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves each as it were a lofty mount. So he sat down and repeated what he might of the Koran and besought Allah the Most High to ease him of his troubles, or by death or by deliverance from such strait. Then he recited for himself the funeral-prayer and cast himself down into the main; but, the waves bore him up by Allah's grace, so that he reached the water unhurt, and the angel in whose charge is the sea watched over him, so that the billows bore him safe to land, by the decree of the Most High. Thereupon he rejoiced and praised Almighty Allah and thanked Him; after which he walked on in quest of something to eat, for stress of hunger, and came presently to the place where he had halted with the Magian, Bahram. Then he fared on awhile, till behold, he caught sight of a great palace, rising high in air, and knew it for that of which he had  --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

Oh my God! ekdum Sanjay Dutt dikhta hai.”,Agar humko inki choot jaisi shakal se pyar na hua hota na,Toh hum batate ke yeh sunke humko kaisa lagta hai..,Ek maheene mai aapka sense of humour inke saamne fade ho jaata hai,Then they talk business, “ghar pe kya bolu.. tu kitna kamata hai?”,Phir dheere dheere inke behaviour mai changes aane lagte hai,Aur achanak se inke life mai koi NRI aa jaata hai( Yo mah wassup?),Lekin kabhi muh kholke yeh nahi bolegi ke aapko ch**ne waali hai,They play mind games; and let you do this dirty job,“You deserve someone better, mai bahut buri hu, khush rehna tu.”,End mein lagta hai, aap hi ne ki hai bechari pe na jaane kitne paap,Apne convenience ke hisab se yeh pat se badal jaati hai,Agar bahut umad umad ke pyar aa raha hai toh zaroor aapse kuch chahti hai,You’re only there till she finds someone better then you,Uske baad who are you, arey Benchod and kaun hai re tuu,Humko lagta hai yeh sirf humare saath hua hai lekin bhai sabki yahi story hai,Nigal bhi nahi sakte ugal bhi nahi sakte, ajeeb si yeh majboori hai,Isi liye aaplog meri lyrics se itna zyada kar rahe ho relate,Maine bhi frustrate hoke hi kar raha hu yaar yeh story narrate,Humari gaandh maarte maarte bhale yeh kabhi nahi thakti hai,Lekin lent upwaas roz ekdum yaad se yeh rakhti hai,Now even God knows that you guys are so fucking fake,Hanste honge woh upar tumhari jhoote bhakti dekh,Bhagwan kare jo maine saha uska at least aadha tu bhi bhoge,Aur tu bhi jaane kaisa lagta hai apna sab kuch khoke,Teri aakhon ke saamne tera boyfriend kisi aur ko kiss kare,Aur sari raat tu ro rokar bas mujhko miss kare,If my love was true toh tu dekhna tere saath yeh sabkuch hoga,Uparwala mujhe bhi toh dega tujhpe hansne ka ek mauka,Don't even think of coming back, because now I hate you from my heart”,Ab swap hone waale hai hum dono ke haalat,,Tujhe yah sab kehke bhenchod mujhe bura kyu lag raha hai,Kyu mujhe har jagah tera yeh manhoos chehra dikh raha hai,Mujhe barbaad karke bhi kyu tu mere dimag se nahi jaati hai,Kyu subah sham bas mujhe teri yaad aati hai,Kyuuuu,,,Rateein meri,Baatein teri,Sari mulakate teri,Jaane kaise tujhko,Mai batau,Kaise bhulau tujhe,Dil se mitau tujhe..,Kaise dil ke aag bhujaunnEmbed --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

      "Error translating text: THE VAMPIRE IN LITERATURE,,A consideration of the Vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic, if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal. Any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. It is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. Accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the Vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this Chapter will serve once for all. In such a story, for example, as Dr. M. R. James' Count Magnus is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? The writer has left the point ambiguous. It is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. It will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in Sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in Vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain Count Magnus de la Gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrgård. Even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. Reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. Two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. They are warned: \"No, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. They should be resting, not walking.\" The two men laughed and cried: \"The Count is dead; we do not care for him.\" But in the night the villagers \"hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him.\" Then they hear a hideous laugh, \"it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all.\" In the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. \"He was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones.\" The other man is standing with his back against a tree, \"pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.\",,There was some vague gossip that the Count had been \"on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him.\" During his investigation of the papers the English traveller, Mr. Wraxall, found a Liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the Count had once journeyed to the city of Chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. In careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, Mr. Wraxall exclaims: \"Ah, Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly like to see you.\" He is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. In a state of frenzied fear he sets out for England the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. Upon landing at Harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. He finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. He is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how \"the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.\",,This story may, I think, certainly be considered as Vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural I have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. It is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. No ghost story should be of any length. The horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. The ghost is malevolent and odious. In fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. The authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. Nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.,,To review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.,,Since some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the Vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in German Universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. Thus among the poems of Heinrich August Ossenfelder we have a short piece entitled Der Vampir, which is as follows:,,Mein liebes Mägdchen glaubet,Beständig steif und feste,,An die gegebnen Lehren,Der immer frommen Mutter,Als Völker an der Theyse,An tödtliche Vampiere,Heyduckisch feste glauben,,Nun warte nur Christianchen,,Du willst mich gar nich lieben;,Ich will mich an dir rächen,,Und heute in Tockayer,Zu einem Vampir trinken.,Und wenn du sanfte schlummerst,,Von deinen schönen Wangen,Den frischen Purpur saugen.,Alsdenn wirst du erschrecken,,Wenn ich dich werde küssen,Und als ein Vampir küssen:,Wann du dann recht erzitterst,Und matt in meine Arme,,Gleich einer Todten sinkest,Alsdenn will ich dich fragen,,Sind meine Lehren besser,,Als deiner guten Mutter?,The poet Wieland has a passing reference to the Vampire,,Der Jüngling aus den Wolken,Herab gefallen, stumm und bleich,,Als hätt' ein Vampyr ihm die Adern ausgemolken,,Steht ganz vernichtet von dem Streich.,,It would be an exaggeration to say that the Vampire entered German literature with Goethe's famous ballad Die Braut von Korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from Phlegon of Tralles. The young Athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the Vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:,,Aus dem Grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,,Noch zu suchen das vermifste Gut,,Noch den schon verlornen Mann zu lieben Und zu saugen seines Herzens Blut.,Ist's um den geschehn,,Muss nach andern gehn,,Und das junge Volk erliegt der Wut.,,Even more famous are the charnel horrors of Bürger's Lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the Gottinger Musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof Brandl gives an ample list has remained a household word.,,In spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary England for German romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of Lenore was published here until 1796, when William Taylor of Norwich printed in the Monthly Review of March his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. He had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790, and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in Norwich literary circles. We know that Mrs. Barbauld who visited Edinburgh \"about the summer of 1793 or 1794\" read aloud Taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. This event was described to Sir Walter Scott by Miss Cranstoun, afterwards Countess Purgstall, although Scott himself mentions that his curiosity \"was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard Lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence, had remained impressed on his memory.\" This gentleman Was Mr. Cranstoun, the brother of Countess Purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as Scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. It was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that Scott made his own rendering of the ballad. The account of Taylor's version, Ellenore, which \"electrified\" the assembled company at Dugald Stewart's house when read by the famous Anna Letitia Barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. Just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of Bürger's works was conveyed to him from Hamburg. He immediately devoured the German ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about Englishing it. \"I well recollect\" he writes, \"that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning.\" Scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,\" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. In 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from Bürger by Taylor and by Scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of W. R. Spencer, H. J. Pye and J. T. Stanley. The translation by the last named author was given to the public in an édition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown. In 1797, a pasquil followed, Miss Kitty: a Parody on Lenora, a Ballad, \"Translated from the German, by several Hands,\" whilst in the following year, Mrs. Taylor turned the popular poem into Italian as a \"Novella Morale.\" Probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the Rev. J. Beresford which was published in 1800.,,It was in 1797 that Coleridge wrote the first part of Christabel, and German critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of Lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. For example, if the narrative of Geraldine be carefully read it must be evident that the following judgment of Professor Brandl is without foundation. This critic writes: \"Ihre Vorgeschichte (of Geraldine) schöpfte er grossentheils aus Bürgers 'Lenore' in Taylors Uebersetzung: die Dame ist, wenigstens ihrer Erzählung nach, auf einem windschnellen Ross entführt und halbtodt vor Furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen Leichenzuges, der Lenoren auf ihrem Ritt durch die Mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den Schatten der Nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte Blatt neben ihr wie aus Herzenangst.\",,As we might expect, the young Shelley was enchanted by Lenore, and Medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand.\" Dowden tells the story how one Christmas Eve Shelley dramatically related the Bürger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture \"working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest \"that the company fully expected to see Wilhelm stalk into the parlour.\" In his study of Shelley, Charles Middleton has remarked: \"It is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the Leonora of Bürgher first awakened his poetic faculty. A tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself.\" To suggest, as Zeiger would have it, that Lenore influenced the poem which in the romance St. Irvyne Megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:,,Ghosts of the dead! have I not heard your yelling,Rise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .,is the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from \"Lachin y Gair\" in Byron's Hours of Idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.,,As I have elsewhere shown in some detail, Shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya: or The Moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares \"quite enraptured\" him. It is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as Die Braut von Korinth and Lenore the novelists of the Gothic school, soaked though they were in German literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the Vampire. It is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as Monk Lewis, \"Apollo's sexton,\" who would fain \"make Parnassus a churchyard\"; and Charles Robert Maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions, et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. In the Gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: \"Surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders.\" We have such titles as the famous Horrid Mysteries; The Midnight Groan; The Abbot of Montserrat, or, The Pool of Blood; The Demon of Venice; The Convent Spectre; The Hag of the Mountains; and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to Polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as I am aware, do we meet with the Vampire in the realm of Gothic fancy. So vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that I hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. There may be some romance which I have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case I am at least prepared to say that the Vampire was not generally known to Gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school I think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. Inevitably one of the band, T. J. Horseley Carties, Francis Lathom, William Herbert, Edward Montague, Mrs. Roche, Eliza Parsons, Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Helme, Mrs. Meeke, Isabella Kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the Vampire in some funereal episode.,,One might even have supposed that the notes to Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer, must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in Book VIII could not have passed unnoticed:,,A night of darkness and of storms!,Into the Chamber of the Tomb,Thalaba led the Old Man,,To roof him from the rain.,A night of storms! the wind,Swept through the moonless sky,,And moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;,And in the pauses if its sweep,They heard the heavy rain,Beat on the monument above.,In silence on Oneiza's grave,Her father and her husband sate.,The Cryer from the Minaret,Proclaim'd the midnight hour.,\"Now, now!\" cried Thalaba;,And o'er the chamber of the tomb,There spread a lurid gleam,,Like the reflection of a sulphur fire,And in that hideous light,Oneiza stood before them. It was She . . .,Her very lineaments. . . . and such as death,Had changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;,But in her eye there dwelt,Brightness more terrible,Than all the loathsomeness of death.,\"Still art thou living, wretch? \",In hollow tones she cried to Thalaba;,\"And must I nightly leave my grave,To tell thee, still in vain,,God hath abandoned thee?,\"This is not she!\" the Old Man exclaim'd;,\"A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!\",And to the youth he held his lance;,\"Strike and deliver thyself!\",\"Strike HER!\" cried Thalaba,,And palsied of all power,,Gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.,\"Yea, strike her!\" cried a voice, whose tones,Flow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,,As when the desert shower,From death deliver'd him;,But obedient to that well-known voice,,His eye was seeking it,,When Moath, firm of heart,,Perform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse,He thrust his lance; it fell,,And howling with the wound,,Its fiendish tenant fled.,A sapphire light fell on them,,And garmented with glory, in their sight,Oneiza's spirit stood.,,It is important to remark that in his notes upon this passage Southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the Lettres Juives, the Vampires of Gradisch, also the history of Arnold Paul, and the very ample account given by Tournefort. He further says: \"The Turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. If any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he  is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. The merchants (at Constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a Janisary with them. Passing by the burying place of the Jews, it happened that an old Jew sat by a sepulchre. The Janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--Roger North's Life of Sir Dudley North.\",,It might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the Marquis de Sade Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu and Juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. In the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as La Nouvelle Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu, suivie de l'Histoire de Juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which Justine occupies four and Juliette six) Justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. In Justine we have the episodes in the house of Monsieur Rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the Comte de Gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster Roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. Many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in Juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the Muscovite giant Minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and Cordelli, the necrophilist of Ancona.,,In The New Monthly Magazine, 1 April, 1819, was published The Vampyre: a Tale by Lord Byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in Le Fanu and M. R. James--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the Continent than in England. It was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of Lord Byron, but had been written by Dr. John William Polidori, physician-companion to the poet. Byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in Galignani's edition of his works. A first printed, The Vampyre forms a part of extracts from \"A letter from Geneva, with Anecdotes of Lord Byron.\" Here is to be read that \"among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord Byron, Mr. p. B. Shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of Godwin and Dr. Polidori) before alluded to after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. It was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord Byron, the physician, and Miss M. Godwin. My friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the ébauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence.\" Upon this the Editor has the following note: \"We have in our possession the Tale of Dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of Miss Godwin. The latter has already appeared under the title of 'Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.\",,The Vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. This preamble commences: \"The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\",,The Editor then recounts the famous instance of Arnold Paul, and continues: \"We have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. This supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'Giaour.',,But first on earth, as Vampyre sent,,Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent;,Then ghastly haunt thy native place,,And suck the blood of all thy race;,There from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283,At midnight drain the stream of life;,Yet loathe the banquet, which perforce,Must feed thy livid living corse,,Thy victims, ere they yet expire,,Shall know the demon for their sire;,As cursing thee, thou cursing them,,Thy flowers are withered on the stem.,But one that for thy crime must fall,,The youngest, best beloved of all,,Shall bless thee with a father's name--,That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!,Yet thou must end thy task and mark,Her check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,,And the last glassy glance must view,Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;,Then with unhallowed hand shall tear,The tresses of her yellow hair,,Of which, in life a lock when shorn,Affection's fondest pledge was worn--,But now is borne away by thee,Memorial o thine agony!,Yet with thine own best blood shall drip,Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;,Then stalking to thy sullen grave,Go--and with Ghouls and Afrits rave,,Till these in horror shrink away,From spectre more accursed than they.\",,After an allusion to Southey's Thalaba, Tournefort's Travels, and Dom Calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: \"We could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\",,The story tells how at the height of a London season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass.\" This original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets \"a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey\" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood.\" Aubrey is greatly fascinated by Lord Ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the Continent he mentions this intention to my Lord, and is \"surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\",,As they travelled from town to town, Aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. However the recipients of this charity \"inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery.\" Eventually the travellers arrive at Rome, and here Aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from London the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. At Rome Aubrey is able to foil Lord Ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he \"directed his steps towards Greece, and, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens.\" Here he lodges in the house of a Greek, whose daughter Ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. As he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with Greek legend and tradition, and \"often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\",,Before long it becomes evident that Aubrey is in love with Ianthe, \"and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him.\" He endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. When Ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, \"as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\",,Having given his promise to Ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. The exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. The steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of  --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n",

      "Error translating text: There was once, in time of old, a merchant hight Abd al-Rahmán, whom Allah had blessed with a son and daughter, and for their much beauty and loveliness, he named the girl Kaubab al-Sabáh and the boy Kamar al-Zamán. When he saw what Allah had vouchsafed the twain of beauty and loveliness, brilliancy and symmetry, he feared for them the evil eyes of the espiers and the jibing tongues of the jealous and the craft of the crafty and the wiles of the wicked and shut them up from the folk in a mansion for the space of fourteen years, during which time none saw them save their parents and a slave-girl who served them. Now their father could recite the Koran, even as Allah sent it down, as also did his wife, wherefore the mother taught her daughter to read and recite it and the father his son till both had gotten it by heart. Moreover, the twain learned from their parents writing and reckoning and all manner of knowledge and polite letters and needed no master. When Kamar al-Zaman came to years of manhood, the wife said to her husband, \"How long wilt thou keep thy son Kamar al-Zaman sequestered from the eyes of the folk? Is he a girl or a boy?\" He answered, \"A boy.\" Rejoined she, \"An he be a boy, why dost thou not carry him to the bazar and seat him in thy shop, that he may know the folk and they know him, to the intent that it may become notorious among men that he is thy son, and do thou teach him to sell and to buy. Peradventure somewhat may befal thee; so shall the folk know him for thy son and he shall lay his hand on thy leavings. But, an thou die, as the case now is, and he say to the folk, 'I am the son of the merchant Abd al-Rahman,' verily they will not believe him, but will cry, 'We have never seen thee and we knew not that he had a son,' wherefore the government will seize thy goods and thy son will be despoiled. In like manner the girl; I mean to make her known among the folk, so may be some one of her own condition may ask her in marriage and we will wed her to him and rejoice in her.\" Quoth he, \"I did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk,\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,,,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Merchant's wife spake to him in such wise, he replied, \"I did thus of my fear for them from the eyes of the folk and because I love them both and love is jealous exceedingly and well saith he who spoke these verses,,,'Of my sight I am jealous for thee, of me, * Of thyself, of thy,            stead, of thy destiny:,Though I shrined thee in eyes by the craze of me * In such,             nearness irk I should never see:,Though thou wert by my side all the days of me * Till Doomsday I,             ne'er had enough of thee.'\",,Said his wife, \"Put thy trust in Allah, for no harm betideth him whom He protecteth, and carry him with thee this very day to the shop.\" Then she clad the boy in the costliest clothes and he became a seduction to all who on him cast sight and an affliction to the heart of each lover wight. His father took him and carried him to the market, whilst all who saw him were ravished with him and accosted him, kissing his hand and saluting him with the salam. Quoth one, \"Indeed the sun hath risen in such a place and blazeth in the bazar,\" and another, \"The rising-place of the full moon is in such a quarter;\" and a third, \"The new moon of the Festival hath appeared to the creatures of Allah.\" And they went on to allude to the boy in talk and call down blessings upon him. But his father scolded the folk for following his son to gaze upon him, because he was abashed at their talk, but he could not hinder one of them from talking; so he fell to abusing the boy's mother and cursing her because she had been the cause of his bringing him out. And as he gazed about he still saw the folk crowding upon him behind and before. Then he walked on till he reached his shop and opening it, sat down and seated his son before him: after which he again looked out and found the thoroughfare blocked with people for all the passers-by, going and coming, stopped before the shop to stare at that beautiful face and could not leave him; and all the men and women crowded in knots about him, applying to themselves the words of him who said,,,\"Thou madest Beauty to spoil man's sprite * And saidst, 'O my,           servants, fear My reprove:',But lovely Thou lovest all loveliness * How, then, shall thy,            servants refrain from Love?\",,When the merchant Abd al-Rahman saw the folk thus crowding about him and standing in rows, both women and men, to fix eyes upon his son, he was sore ashamed and confounded and knew not what to do; but presently there came up from the end of the bazar a man of the wandering Dervishes, clad in haircloth, the garb of the pious servants of Allah and seeing Kamar al-Zaman sitting there as he were a branch of Bán springing from a mound of saffron, poured forth copious tears and recited these two couplets,,,\"A wand uprising from a sandy knoll, * Like full moon shining,            brightest sheen, I saw;,And said, 'What is thy name?' Replied he 'Lúlú' * 'What' (asked,            I) 'Lily?' and he answered 'Lá, lá!'\",Then the Dervish fell to walking, now drawing near and now moving away, and wiping his gray hairs with his right hand, whilst the heart of the crowd was cloven asunder for awe of him. When he looked upon the boy, his eyes were dazzled and his wit confounded, and exemplified in him was the saying of the poet,,,\"While that fair-faced boy abode in the place, * Moon of,             breakfast-fête he lit by his face,,Lo! there came a Shaykh with leisurely pace * A reverend trusting,             to Allah's grace,,                          And ascetic signals his gait display'd.,He had studied Love both by day and night * And had special,             knowledge of Wrong and Right;,Both for lad and lass had repined his sprite, * And his form like,            toothpick was lean and slight,,                          And old bones with faded skin were o'erlaid.,In such arts our Shaykh was an Ajamí * With a catamite,             ever in company;,In the love of woman, a Platonist he * But in either,            versed to the full degree,,                         And Zaynab to him was the same as Zayd.,Distraught by the Fair he adored the Fair * O'er Spring-camp,           wailed, bewept ruins bare.,Dry branch thou hadst deemed him for stress o' care, * Which the,            morning breeze swayeth here and there,,                         For only the stone is all hardness made!,In the lore of Love he was wondrous wise * And wide awake with,            all-seeing eyes.,Its rough and its smooth he had tried and tries * And hugged buck,            and doe in the self-same guise,                          And with greybeard and beardless alike he,play'd.\",Then he came up to the boy and gave him a root of sweet basil, whereupon his father put forth his hand to his pouch and brought out for him some small matter of silver, saying, \"Take thy portion, O Dervish, and wend thy ways.\" He took the dirhams, but sat down on the masonry-bench alongside the shop and opposite the boy and fell to gazing upon him and heaving sigh upon sigh, whilst his tears flowed like springs founting. The folk began to look at him and remark upon him, some saying, \"All Dervishes are lewd fellows,\" and other some, \"Verily, this Dervish's heart is set on fire for love of this lad.\" Now when Abd al-Rahman saw this case, he arose and said to the boy, \"Come, O my son, let us lock up the shop and hie us home, for it booteth not to sell and buy this day; and may Almighty Allah requite thy mother that which she hath done with us, for she was the cause of all this!\" Then said he, \"O Dervish, rise, that I may shut my shop.\" So the Dervish rose and the merchant shut his shop and taking his son, walked away. The Dervish and the folk followed them, till they reached their place, when the boy went in and his father, turning to the Dervish, said to him, \"What wouldst thou, O Dervish, and why do I see thee weep?\" He replied, \"O my lord, I would fain be thy guest this night, for the guest is the guest of Almighty Allah.\" Quoth the merchant, \"Welcome to the guest of God: enter, O Dervish!\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,,When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,,,She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the merchant, the father of Kamar al-Zaman, heard the saying of the Dervish, \"I am Allah's guest,\" he replied, \"Welcome to the guest of God: enter, O Dervish!\" But he said to himself, \"An the beggar be enamoured of the boy and sue him for sin, needs must I slay him this very night and bury him secretly. But, an there be no lewdness in him, the guest shall eat his portion.\" Then he brought him into a saloon, where he left him with Kamar al-Zaman, after he had said privily to the lad, \"O my son, sit thou beside the Dervish when I am gone out and sport with him and provoke him to love-liesse and if he seek of thee lewdness, I who will be watching you from the window overlooking the saloon will come down to him and kill him.\" So, as soon as Kamar al-Zaman was alone in the room with the Dervish, he sat down by his side and the old man began to look upon him and sigh and weep. Whenever the lad bespake him, he answered him kindly, trembling the while and would turn to him groaning and crying, and thus he did till supper was brought in, when he fell to eating, with his eyes on the boy but refrained not from shedding tears. When a fourth part of the night was past and talk was ended and sleep-tide came, Abd al-Rahman said to the lad, \"O my son, apply thyself to the service of thine uncle the Dervish and gainsay him not:\" and would have gone out; but the Dervish cried to him, \"O my lord, carry thy son with thee or sleep with us.\" Answered the merchant, \"Nay, my son shall lie with thee: haply thy soul may desire somewhat, and he will look to thy want and wait upon thee.\" Then he went out leaving them both together, and sat down in an adjoining room which had a window giving upon the saloon. Such was the case with the merchant; but as to the lad, as soon as his sire had left them, he came up to the Dervish and began to provoke him and offer himself to him, whereupon he waxed wroth and said, \"What talk is this, O my son? I take refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned! O my Lord, indeed this is a denial of Thee which pleaseth Thee not! Avaunt from me, O my son!\" So saying, the Dervish arose and sat down at a distance; but the boy followed him and threw himself upon him, saying, \"Why, O Dervish, wilt thou deny thyself the joys of my possession, and I with a heart that loveth thee?\" Hereupon the Dervish's anger redoubled and he said, \"An thou refrain not from me, I will summon thy sire and tell him of thy doings.\" Quoth the lad, \"My father knoweth my turn for this and it may not be that he will hinder me: so heal thou my heart. Why dost thou hold off from me? Do I not please thee?\" Answered the Dervish, \"By Allah, O my son, I will not do this, though I be hewn in pieces with sharp-edged swords!\"; and he repeated the saying of the poet,,,\"Indeed my heart loves all the lovely boys * As girls; nor am I,             slow to such delight,,But, though I sight them every night and morn, * I'm neither of,            Lot's folk nor wencher-wight.\",,Then he shed tears and said, \"Arise, open the door, that I may wend my way, for I will lie no longer in this lodging.\" Therewith he rose to his feet; but the boy caught hold of him, saying, \"Look at the fairness of my face and the cramoisy of my cheeks and the softness of my sides and the lusciousness of my lips.\" Moreover he discovered to him calves that would shame wine and cupcarrier and gazed on him with fixed glance that would baffle enchanter and enchantments; for he was passing of loveliness and full of blandishment, even as saith of him one of the poets who sang,,,\"I can't forget him, since he rose and showed with fair design *,          Those calves of legs whose pearly shine make light in,            nightly gloom:,Wonder not an my flesh uprise as though 'twere Judgment-day *,             When every shank shall bared be and that is Day of,             Doom.\",,Then the boy displayed to him his bosom, saying, \"Look at my breasts which be goodlier than the breasts of maidens and my lip-dews are sweeter than sugar-candy. So quit scruple and asceticism and cast off devoutness and abstinence and take thy fill of my possession and enjoy my loveliness. Fear naught, for thou art safe from hurt, and leave this hebetude for 'tis a bad habit.\" And he went on to discover to him his hidden beauties, striving to turn the reins of his reason with his bendings in graceful guise, whilst the Dervish turned away his face and said, \"I seek refuge with Allah! Have some shame, O my son! This is a forbidden thing I deem and I will not do it, no, not even in dream.\" The boy pressed upon him, but the Dervish got free from him and turning towards Meccah addressed himself to his devotions. Now when the boy saw him praying, he left him till he had prayed a two-bow prayer and saluted, when he would have accosted him again; but the Dervish again repeated the intent and prayed a second two-bow prayer, and thus he did a third and a fourth and a fifth time. Quoth the lad, \"What prayers are these? Art thou minded to take flight upon the clouds? Thou lettest slip our delight, whilst thou passest the whole night in the prayer-niche.\" So saying, he threw himself upon the Dervish and kissed him between the eyes; but the Shaykh said, \"O my son, put Satan away from thine estate and take upon thee obedience of the Compassionate.\" Quoth the other, \"An thou do not with me that which I desire, I will call my sire and say to him, The Dervish is minded to do lewdness with me. Whereupon he will come in to thee and beat thee till thy bones be broken upon thy flesh.\" All this while Abd al-Rahman was watching with his eyes and hearkening with his ears, and he was certified that there was no frowardness in the Dervish and he said to himself, \"Were he a lewd fellow, he had not stood out against all this importunity.\" The boy continued to beguile the Dervish and every time he expressed purpose of prayer, he interrupted him, till at last he waxed wroth with passing wrath and was rough with him and beat him. Kamar al-Zaman wept and his father came in and having wiped away his tears and comforted him said to the Dervish, \"O my brother, since thou art in such case, why didst thou weep and sigh when thou sawest my son? Say me, is there a reason for this?\" He replied, \"There is;\" and Abd al-Rahman pursued, \"When I saw thee weep at his sight, I deemed evil of thee and bade the boy do with thee thus, that I might try thee, purposing in myself, if I saw thee sue him for sin, to come in upon thee and kill thee. But, when I saw what thou didst, I knew thee for one of those who are virtuous to the end. Now Allah upon thee, tell me the cause of thy weeping!\" The Dervish sighed and said, \"O my lord, chafe not a closed wound.\" But the merchant said, \"There is no help but thou tell me;\" and the other began, \"Know thou that I am a Dervish who wander in the lands and the countries, and take warning by the display of the Creator of Night and Day. It chanced that one Friday I entered the city of Bassorah in the undurn.\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,,,She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Dervish said to the merchant, \"Know, then, that I a wandering mendicant chanced one Friday to enter the city of Bassorah in the undurn and saw the shops open and full of all manner of wares and meat and drink; but the place was deserted and therein was neither man nor woman nor girl nor boy: nor in the markets and the main streets was there dog or cat nor sounded sound nor friend was found. I marvelled at this end and said to myself, 'I wonder whither the people of the city be gone with their cats and dogs and what hath Allah done with them?' Now I was anhungred so I took hot bread from a baker's oven and going into the shop of an oilman, spread the bread with clarified butter and honey and ate. Then I entered the shop of a sherbet-seller and drank what I would; after which, seeing a coffee-shop open, I went in and found the pots on the fire, full of coffee; but there was no one there. So I drank my fill and said, 'Verily, this is a wondrous thing! It seemeth as though Death had stricken the people of this city and they had all died this very hour, or as if they had taken fright at something which befel them and fled, without having time to shut their shops.' Now whilst pondering this matter, lo! I heard a sound of a band of drums beating; whereat I was afraid and hid myself for a while: then, looking out through a crevice, I saw damsels, like moons, come walking through the market, two by two, with uncovered heads and faces displayed. They were in forty pairs, thus numbering fourscore and in their midst a young lady, riding on a horse that could hardly move his legs for that which was upon it of silvern trappings and golden and jewelled housings. Her face was wholly unveiled, and she was adorned with the costliest ornaments and clad in the richest of raiment and about her neck she wore a collar of gems and on her bosom were necklaces of gold; her wrists were clasped with bracelets which sparkled like stars, and her ankles with bangles of gold set with precious stones. The slave-girls walked before her and behind and on her right and left and in front of her was a damsel bearing in baldric a great sword, with grip of emerald and tassels of jewel-encrusted gold. When that young lady came to where I lay hid, she pulled up her horse and said, 'O damsels, I hear a noise of somewhat within yonder shop: so do ye search it, lest haply there be one hidden there, with intent to enjoy a look at us, whilst we have our faces unveiled.' So they searched the shop opposite the coffee-house wherein I lay hid, whilst I abode in terror; and presently I saw them come forth with a man and they said to her, 'O our lady, we found a man there and here he is before thee.' Quoth she to the damsel with the sword, 'Smite his neck.' So she went up to him and struck off his head; then, leaving the dead man lying on the ground, they passed on. When I saw this, I was affrighted; but my heart was taken with love of the young lady. After an hour or so, the people reappeared and every one who had a shop entered it; whilst the folk began to come and go about the bazars and gathered around the slain man, staring at him as a curiosity. Then I crept forth from my hiding place by stealth, and none took note of me, but love of that lady had gotten possession of my heart, and I began to enquire of her privily. None, however, gave me news of her; so I left Bassorah, with vitals yearning for her love; and when I came upon this thy son, I saw him to be the likest of all creatures to the young lady; wherefore he reminded me of her and his sight revived the fire of passion in me and kindled anew in my heart the flames of love-longing and distraction. And such is the cause of my shedding tears!\" Then he wept with sore weeping till he could no more and said, \"O my lord, I conjure thee by Allah, open the door to me, so I may gang my gait!\" Accordingly Abd al-Rahman opened the door and he went forth. Thus fared it with him; but as regards Kamar al-Zaman, when he heard the Dervish's story, his heart was taken with love of the lady and passion gat the mastery of him and raged in him longing and distraction; so, on the morrow, he said to his sire, \"All the sons of the merchants wander about the world to attain their desire, nor is there one of them but his father provideth for him a stock-in-trade wherewithal he may travel and traffic for gain. Why, then, O my father, dost thou not outfit me with merchandise, so I may fare with it and find my luck?\" He replied, \"O my son, such merchants lack money; so they send their sons to foreign parts for the sake of profit and pecuniary gain and provision of the goods of the world. But I have monies in plenty nor do I covet more: why then should I exile thee? Indeed, I cannot brook to be parted from thee an hour, more especially as thou art unique in beauty and loveliness and perfect grace and I fear for thee.\" But Kamar al-Zaman said, \"O my father, nothing will serve but thou must furnish me with merchandise wherewithal to travel; else will I fly from thee at unawares though without money or merchandise. So, an thou wish to solace my heart, make ready for me a stock-in-trade, that I may travel and amuse myself by viewing the countries of men.\" Abd al-Rahman, seeing his son enamoured of travel, acquainted his wife with this, saying, \"Verily thy son would have me provide him with goods, so he may fare therewith to far regions, albeit Travel is Travail.\" Quoth she, \"What is there to displease thee in this? Such is the wont of the sons of the merchants and they all vie one with other in glorifying globe-trotting and gain.\" Quoth he, \"Most of the merchants are poor and seek growth of good; but I have wealth galore.\" She replied, \"More of a good thing hurteth not; and, if thou comply not with his wish, I will furnish him with goods of my own monies.\" Quoth Abd al-Rahman, \"I fear strangerhood for him, inasmuch as travel is the worst of trouble;\" but she said, \"There is no harm in strangerhood for him when it leadeth to gaining good; and, if we consent not, our son will go away and we shall seek him and not find him and be dishonoured among the folk.\" The merchant accepted his wife's counsel and provided his son with merchandise to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces, whilst his mother gave him a purse containing forty bezel-stones, jewels of price, the least of the value of one of which was five hundred ducats, saying, \"O my son, be careful of this jewellery for 'twill be of service to thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman took the jewels and set out for Bassorah,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.,When it was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,,,She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman took the jewels and set out for Bassorah after he had laid them in a belt, which he buckled about his waist; and he stayed not till there remained aught but a day's journey between that city and himself; when the Arabs came out upon him and stripped him naked and slew his men and servants; but he laid himself down among the slain and wallowed in their blood, so that the wildlings took him for dead and left him without even turning him over and made off with their booty. When the Arabs had gone their ways, Kamar al-Zaman arose, having naught left but the jewels in his girdle, and fared on nor ceased faring till he came to Bassorah. It chanced that his entry was on a Friday and the town was void of folk, even as the Dervish had informed him. He found the market-streets deserted and the shops wide open and full of goods; so he ate and drank and looked about him. Presently, he heard a band of drums beating and hid himself in a shop, till the slave-girls came up, when he looked at them; and, seeing the young lady riding amongst them, love and longing overcame him and desire and distraction overpowered him, so that he had no force to stand. After awhile, the people reappeared and the bazars filled. Whereupon he went to the market and repairing to a jeweller and pulling out one of his forty gems sold it for a thousand dinars, wherewith he returned to his place and passed the night there; and when morning morrowed he changed his clothes and going to the Hamman came forth as he were the full moon. Then he sold other four stones for four thousand dinars and sauntered solacing himself about the main streets of Bassorah, clad in the costliest of clothes; till he came to a market, where he saw a barber's shop. So he went in to the barber who shaved his head; and, clapping up an acquaintance with him, said to him, \"O my father, I am a stranger in these parts and yesterday I entered this city and found it void of folk, nor was there in it any living soul, man nor Jinni. Then I saw a troop of slave-girls and amongst them a young lady riding in state:\" and he went on to tell him all he had seen. Said the barber, \"O my son, hast thou told any but me of this?\"; and he said, \"No.\" The other rejoined, \"Then, O my son, beware thou mention this before any but me; for all folk cannot keep a secret and thou art but a little lad and I fear lest the talk travel from man to man, till it reach those whom it concerneth and they slay thee. For know, O my son, that this thou hast seen, none ever kenned nor knew in other than this city. As for the people of Bassorah they are dying of this annoy; for every Friday forenoon they shut up the dogs and cats, to hinder them from going about the market-streets, and all the people of the city enter the cathedral-mosques, where they lock the doors on them and not one of them can pass about the bazar nor even look out of casement; nor knoweth any the cause of this calamity. But, O my son, to-night I will question my wife concerning the reason thereof, for she is a midwife and entereth the houses of the notables and knoweth all the city news. So Inshallah, do thou come to me to-morrow and I will tell thee what she shall have told me.\" With this Kamar al-Zaman pulled out a handful of gold and said to him, \"O my father, take this gold and give it to thy wife, for she is become my mother.\" Then he gave him a second handful, saying, \"Take this for thyself.\" Whereupon quoth the barber, \"O my son, sit thou in thy place, till I go to my wife and ask her and bring the news of the true state of the case.\" So saying, he left him in the shop and going home, acquainted his wife with the young man's case, saying, \"I would have thee tell me the truth of this city-business, so I may report it to this young merchant, for he hath set his heart on weeting the reason why men and beasts are forbidden the market-streets every Friday forenoon; and methinks he is a lover, for he is openhanded and liberal, and if we tell him what he would trow, we shall get great good of him.\" Quoth she, \"Go back and say to him, 'Come, speak with thy mother, my wife, who sendeth her salam to thee and saith to thee, Thy wish is won.'\" Accordingly he returned to the shop, where he found Kamar al-Zaman sitting awaiting him and repeated him the very words spoken by his spouse. Then he carried him in to her and she welcomed him and bade him sit down; whereupon he pulled out an hundred ducats and gave them to her, saying, \"O my mother, tell me who this young lady may be.\" Said she, \"Know, O my son, that there came a gem to the Sultan of Bassorah from the King of Hind, and he was minded to have it pierced. So he summoned all the jewellers in a body and said to them, 'I wish you to drill me this jewel. Whoso pierceth it, I will give him whatsoever he shall ask; but if he break it, I will cut off his head.' At this they were afraid and said, 'O King of the age, a jewel is soon spoilt and there are few who can pierce them without injury, for most of them have a flaw. So do not thou impose upon us a task to which we are unable; for our hands cannot avail to drill this jewel. However, our Shaykh is more experienced than we.' Asked the King, 'And who is your Shaykh?'; and they answered, 'Master Obayd: he is more versed than we in this art and hath wealth galore and of skill great store. Therefore do thou send for him to the presence and bid him pierce thee this jewel.' Accordingly the King sent for Obayd and bade him pierce the jewel, imposing on him the condition aforesaid. He took it and pierced it to the liking of the King who said to him, 'Ask a boon of me, O master'; and said he, 'O King of the age, allow me delay till to-morrow.' Now the reason of this was that he wished to take counsel with his wife, who is the young lady thou sawest riding in procession; for he loveth her with exceeding love, and of the greatness of his affection for her, he doth naught without consulting her; wherefore he put off asking till the morrow. When he went home, he said to her, 'I have pierced the King a jewel and he hath granted me a boon which I deferred asking till to-morrow, that I might consult thee. Now what dost thou wish, that I may ask it?' Quoth she, 'We have riches such as fires may not consume; but, an thou love me, ask of the King to make proclamation in the streets of Bassorah that all the townsfolk shall every Friday enter the mosques, two hours before the hour of prayer, so none may abide in the town at all great or small except they be in the mosques or in the houses and the doors be locked upon them, and that every shop of the town be left open. Then will I ride with my slave-women through the heart of the city and none shall look on me from window or lattice; and every one whom I find abroad I will kill.' So he went in to the King and begged of him this boon, which he granted him and caused proclamation to be made amongst the Bassorites,\"—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.,,When is was the Nine Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,,,She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the barber's wife said, \"When the Jeweller begged his boon, the King bade proclamation be made amongst the Bassorites, but the people objected that they feared for their goods from the cats and dogs; wherefore he commanded to shut the animals up till the folk should come forth from the Friday prayers. So the jeweller's wife fell to sallying forth every Friday, two hours before the time of congregational prayer, and riding in state through the city with her women; during which time none dareth pass through the market-place nor look out of casement or lattice. This, then, is what thou wouldest know and I have told thee who she is; but, O my son, was it thy desire only to have news of her or hast thou a mind to meet her?\" Answered he, \"O my mother, 'tis my wish to foregather with her.\" Quoth she, \"Tell me what valuables thou hast with thee\"; and quoth he, \"O my mother, I have with me precious stones of four sorts, the first worth five hundred dinars each, the second seven hundred, the third eight hundred and the fourth a thousand ducats.\" She asked, \"Art thou willing to spend four of these?\"; and he answered, \"I am ready to spend all of them.\" She rejoined, \"Then, arise, O my son, and go straight to thy lodging and take a bezel-gem of those worth five hundred sequins, with which do thou repair to the jewel market and ask for the shop of Master Obayd, the Shaykh of the Jewellers. Go thither and thou wilt find him seated in his shop, clad in rich clothes, with workmen under his hand. Salute him and sit down on the front shelf of his shop; then pull out the jewel and give it to him, saying, 'O master, take this stone and fashion it into a seal-ring for me with gold. Make it not large, a Miskál in weight and no more; but let the fashion of it be thy fairest.' Then give him twenty dinars and to each of his prentices a dinar. Sit with him awhile and talk with him and if a beggar approach thee, show thy generosity by giving him a dinar, to the intent that he may affect thee, and after this, leave him and return to thy place. Pass the night there, and next morning, take an hundred dinars and bring them and give them to thy father the barber, for he is poor.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"Be it so,\" and returning to his caravanserai, took a jewel worth five hundred gold pieces and went with it to the jewel-bazar. There he enquired for the shop of Master Obayd, Shaykh of the Jewellers, and they directed him thereto. So he went thither and saw the Shaykh, a man of austere aspect and robed in sumptuous raiment with four journeymen under his hand. He addressed him with \"Peace be upon you!\" and the jeweller returned his greeting and welcoming him, made him sit down. Then he brought out the jewel and said, \"O master, I wish thee to make me this jewel into a seal-ring with gold. Let it be the weight of a Miskal and no more, but fashion it excellently.\" Then he pulled out twenty dinars and gave them to him, saying, \"This is the fee for chasing and the price of the ring shall remain.\" And he gave each of the apprentices a gold piece, wherefore they loved him, and so did Master Obayd. Then he sat talk --> Text length need to be between 0 and 5000 characters\n"
